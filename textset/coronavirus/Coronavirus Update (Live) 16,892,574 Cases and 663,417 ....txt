     There are three parameters to understand in order to assess the magnitude of the risk posed by this novel coronavirus:  The   or   (how rapidly the disease spreads) of a virus is indicated by its reproductive number (Ro, pronounced   or  ), which represents the average number of people to which a single infected person will transmit the virus. WHO's estimated (on Jan. 23) Ro to be between 1.4 and 2.5.  Other studies have estimated a Ro between 3.6 and 4.0, and between 2.24 to 3.58.  .  Preliminary studies had estimated Ro to be between    An outbreak with a reproductive number of below 1 will gradually disappear. For comparison, the Ro for the common flu is 1.3 and for SARS it was 2.0. The novel coronavirus' case   has been estimated at around  , in the WHO press conference held on January 29, 2020   . However, it noted that, without knowing how many were infected, it was too early to be able to put a percentage on the mortality rate figure.  A prior estimate   had put that number at 3%.  Fatality rate can change as a virus can mutate, according to epidemiologists. For comparison, the case fatality rate for SARS was 10%, and for MERS 34%. Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 (estimated ranges vary from 2-10 days, 2-14 days, and 10-14 days,  ), during which the virus is contagious but the patient does not display any symptom ( ). According to early estimates by China's National Health Commission (NHC), about 80% of those who died were over the age of 60 and 75% of them had
pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and
diabetes. According to the   issued on Jan. 27:
 A study of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP found that the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men.   The WHO, in its  , addresses the question:  by answering that:  
As of Jan. 29, according to French authorities, the conditions of the two earliest Paris cases had worsened and the patients were being treated in intensive care, according to French authorities. The patients have been described as a young couple aged  , both Chinese citizens from Wuhan who were asymptomatic when they arrived in Paris on January 18  .  The NHC reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm on January 22, 2020. The deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median age of the deaths was 75 (range 48-89) years. On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a Global Public Health Emergency. For more information from the WHO regarding novel coronavirus:
