 Pigs, deer, rhinoceroses, and even small elephants. Tigers live in many habitats, including tropical rain forest, snow-covered coniferous and deciduous forests, mangrove swamps, and drier forest areas. Recognizing a tiger at the zoo is easy. But in their natural habitat in scattered, small areas in Asia, tigers are really hard to find. That’s because their unique orange, black, and white stripe pattern helps them blend into the forests and grassy areas where they live and hunt. Tigers are carnivores.   They are quiet, patient hunters with large powerful paws and teeth to help them catch and eat their prey. Some of their favorite meals include pigs, deer, rhinoceroses, and even small elephants. Tigers hunt for their food, but they are also hunted by humans for their valuable fur and body parts. Because of this, tiger researches think there may only be 3,500 tigers left in the world. This makes them an endangered species. Like human fingerprints, every tiger has a unique pattern of stripes that can be used to identify it!  A tiger's canine teeth are 3 inches long. A tiger’s night vision is 6 times better than a human’s.
