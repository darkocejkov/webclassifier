 Basic familiarity with the fundamental concepts of programming HTML Are you a programming beginner? Maybe you've just started, or maybe you've taken a couple of entry-level programming classes and want to learn more. The beginner courses here will show you the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) while teaching you the simple and functional Python programming language. When you've completed this section, you'll be ready to move on to improving your code quality. by Jason Olson Jan 26, 2018 / 1h 5m 1h 5m At the heart of creating software is being able to use the right tool for the right job. In this course, Python: The Big Picture, you'll learn about the Python programming language. First, you'll learn what Python is, what makes it different, and why you should care. Next, you'll explore the different ways Python is being used to develop different types of applications today. Finally, you'll discover how to get started working with Python code and what next steps you can take in your Python journey. When you're finished with this course, you'll have a foundational knowledge of Python that will help you as you move forward to recognizing when Python is the right tool for any future jobs you are faced with as a software developer. 
 by Austin Bingham Dec 12, 2019 / 4h 5m 4h 5m Python is a big language, and it's important to have a thorough grounding in its key concepts in order to be productive and create high-quality Python programs. In our experience, starting off in the right direction and avoiding early misconceptions is crucial to success with Python, and that's the kind of start we aim to provide. In this course, Core Python: Getting Started, we are going to introduce you to the essentials of the Python language as well as important parts of the Python standard library. Some of the major topics that we will cover include: Python's fundamental data types, using functions and modules to organize your code, Python's underlying object model, defining your own types using classes, and working with iteration and iterable objects. By the end this course, you'll have the skills and knowledge to work on almost any Python project, and you'll be in a great position to continue learning more advanced aspects of the language.

 The intermediate courses you see here will teach you to improve your code. You'll dive deeper into unit testing and debugging, as well as learn some of the more advanced features of the Python language. by Robert Smallshire Jul 18, 2014 / 7h 21m 7h 21m Python – Beyond the Basics builds directly on the foundations laid in our introductory Python course, Python Fundamentals. Python is a great dynamic language for web development, big data, science, and scripting. In this course we add breadth and depth to your Python skills, exploring the topics you'll need to create robust and readable applications of any size. On completing this course, you'll be familiar with the majority of Python techniques and constructs used in Python programs. Crucially, we'll also advise you on when – and when not – to use the different tools available in Python to best effect, to maximize the quality of your code, your productivity, and the joy inherent in coding in Python. 
 by Reindert-Jan Ekker May 17, 2019 / 1h 10m 1h 10m In need of core skills for any level python development? In this course, Python Best Practices for Code Quality, you will learn a number of best practices that will help you improve the quality of your Python code. First, you will discover the guidelines for formatting code called Pep8. Next, you will create beautiful and publishable documentation with Python docstrings and a tool called Sphinx. Finally. you will explore how to improve maintainability and prevent errors by adding type hints to your code. By the end of this course, you will be able to write clearer, more readable and more maintainable code with better documentation. 
 by Reindert-Jan Ekker Feb 2, 2019 / 1h 23m 1h 23m Most real-world Python projects make use of code written by others, and usually this code is included by installing Python packages. In this course, Managing Python Packages and Virtual Environments, you will learn everything you need to install and manage the packages your project requires using pip, the Python package installer. When you start working on more than a single project, you will find that there's a need to install packages for one project separately from another project. You will come to understand that there's a tool for this situation as well: virtualenv, and no professional Python developer can go without it. First, you will explore everything you need to know in order to use virtual environments on a daily basis. After covering these two core tools, you will then discover other tools that you should at least be aware of such as virtualenvwrapper, which makes managing virtual environments a lot less painful. Finally, you will discover two newer tools: pipenv and poetry, and the direction the Python community is headed. By the end of this course, you will learn how to manage the requirements of your Python projects using virtual environments and pip, 
 by Emily Bache Jun 28, 2019 / 2h 49m 2h 49m Once you’ve learned the basics of the Python language and started building programs, you will soon realize a need for some automated tests to make sure everything you’ve built keeps on working as you (and other developers) extend and improve it. In this course, Unit Testing with Python, you will learn foundational knowledge in unit testing. First, you will discover how to write and run tests using the ‘unittest’ framework, and some theory about how to design good test cases. Next, you will explore other popular testing frameworks in Python - pytest and doctest. Finally, you will examine how to use test doubles effectively, and techniques for parameterized testing and measuring test coverage. When you’re finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge of writing unit tests needed to be confident adding tests for the code you write, and sharing those tests with other developers.
