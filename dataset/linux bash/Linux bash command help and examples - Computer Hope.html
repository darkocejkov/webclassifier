<p class="tab"><b>bash</b> is an <a href="/jargon/s/sh.htm">sh</a>-compatible command language <a href="/jargon/i/interpre.htm">interpreter</a> that executes commands read from the <a href="/jargon/s/stdin.htm">standard input</a> or from a file. <b>bash</b> also incorporates useful features from the <a href="/jargon/k/korn.htm">Korn</a> and <a href="/jargon/c/c.htm">C</a> <a href="/jargon/s/shell.htm">shells</a> (<a href="/unix/uksh.htm">ksh</a> and <a href="/unix/ucsh.htm">csh</a>).</p>
<p class="tab"><b>bash</b> is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the <a href="/jargon/i/ieee.htm">IEEE</a> <a href="/jargon/p/posix.htm">POSIX</a> specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). <b>bash</b> can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p class="tab">All of the single-<a href="/jargon/c/charact.htm">character</a> shell options documented in the description of the <a href="/unix/uset.htm"><b>set</b></a> builtin command can be used as options when invoking <b>bash</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">The following options are also available:</p>
<table class="mtable3 tab">
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>-c</b> <i>string</i></p></td>

<h2 id="3A">Arguments</h2>
<p class="tab">If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the <b>-c</b> nor the <b>-s</b> option has been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands. If <b>bash</b> is invoked in this fashion, <b>$0</b> is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments. <b>bash</b> reads and executes commands from this file, then exits. <b>bash</b>'s exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory, and if no file is found, the shell searches the directories in <b>PATH</b> for the script.</p>
<h2 id="invocation">Invocation</h2>
<p class="tab">A login shell is one whose first character of argument zero is a <b>-</b>, or one started with the <b>--login</b> option.</p>
<p class="tab">An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments and without the <b>-c</b> option whose standard input and error are both connected to terminals (as determined by <b>isatty</b>), or one started with the <b>-i</b> option. <b>PS1</b> (<a href="/jargon/c/commprom.htm">command prompt</a> string) is set and <b>$-</b> includes <b>i</b> if <b>bash</b> is interactive, allowing a shell script or a startup file to test this state.</p>
<p class="tab">The following paragraphs describe how <b>bash</b> executes its startup files. If any of the files exist but cannot be read, <b>bash</b> reports an error. Tildes are expanded in filenames as described below under "<a href="#tilde-expansion">Tilde Expansion</a>" in the "<a href="#expansion">Expansion</a>" section.</p>
<p class="tab">When <b>bash</b> is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the <b>--login</b> option, it first reads and executes commands from the file <b>/etc/profile</b>, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for <b>~/.bash_profile</b>, <b>~/.bash_login</b>, and <b>~/.profile</b>, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The <b>--noprofile</b> option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.</p>
<p class="tab">When a login shell exits, <b>bash</b> reads and executes commands from the file <b>~/.bash_logout</b>, if it exists.</p>
<p class="tab">When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, <b>bash</b> reads and executes commands from <b>/etc/bash.bashrc</b> and <b>~/.bashrc</b>, if these files exist. This may be inhibited by using the <b>--norc</b> option. The <b>--rcfile</b> file option will force <b>bash</b> to read and execute commands from file instead of <b>/etc/bash.bashrc</b> and <b>~/.bashrc</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">When <b>bash</b> is started non-interactively, to run a shell <a href="/jargon/s/script.htm">script</a>, for example, it looks for the variable <b>BASH_ENV</b> in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. <b>Bash</b> behaves as if the following command were executed:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi</pre>
<p class="tab">but the value of the <b>PATH</b> variable is not used to search for the file name.</p>
<p class="tab">If <b>bash</b> is invoked with the name <b>sh</b>, it tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of <b>sh</b> as closely as possible, while conforming to the <a href="/jargon/p/posix.htm">POSIX</a> standard as well. When invoked as an interactive login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the <b>--login</b> option, it first attempts to read and execute commands from <b>/etc/profile</b> and <b>~/.profile</b>, in that order. The <b>--noprofile</b> option may be used to inhibit this behavior. When invoked as an interactive shell with the name <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> looks for the variable <b>ENV</b>, expands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. Since a shell invoked as <b>sh</b> does not attempt to read and execute commands from any other startup files, the <b>--rcfile</b> option has no effect. A non-interactive shell invoked with the name <b>sh</b> does not attempt to read any other startup files. When invoked as <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> enters posix mode after the startup files are read.</p>
<p class="tab">When <b>bash</b> is started in posix mode, as with the <b>--posix</b> command line option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files. In this mode, interactive shells expand the <b>ENV</b> variable and commands are read and executed from the file whose name is the expanded value. No other startup files are read.</p>
<p class="tab"><b>Bash</b> attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input connected to a network connection, as when executed by the <a href="/unix/ursh.htm">remote shell</a> <a href="/jargon/d/daemon.htm">daemon</a>, usually <b>rshd</b>, or the <a href="/jargon/s/ssh.htm">secure shell</a> daemon <b>sshd</b>. If <b>bash</b> determines it is being run in this fashion, it reads and executes commands from <b>~/.bashrc</b> and <b>~/.bashrc</b>, if these files exist and are readable. It will not do this if invoked as <b>sh</b>. The <b>--norc</b> option may be used to inhibit this behavior, and the <b>--rcfile</b> option may be used to force another file to be read, but <b>rshd</b> does not generally invoke the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.</p>
<p class="tab">If the shell is started with the effective user (or group) id not equal to the real user (or group) id, and the <b>-p</b> option is not supplied, no startup files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the environment, the <b>SHELLOPTS</b>, <b>BASHOPTS</b>, <b>CDPATH</b>, and <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is set to the real user id. If the <b>-p</b> option is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.</p>
<h2 id="5A">Definitions</h2>
<p class="tab">In the following sections, these terms are defined as follows:</p>
<table class="mtable3 tab">
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>blank</b></p></td>
<td><p>a blank space or tab.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>word</b></p></td>
<td><p>a sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell. Also known as a <b>token.</b></p></td>

<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>name</b></p></td>
<td><p>a <b>word</b> consisting only of <a href="/jargon/a/alphanum.htm">alphanumeric</a> characters and underscores, and beginning with alphabetic character or an underscore. Also referred to as an <b>identifier</b>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>metacharacter</b></p></td>
<td><p>a character that, when unquoted, separates words. A <b>bash</b> metacharacter is one of the following: <b>|</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>;</b>, <b>(</b>, <b>)</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>space</b>, or <b>tab</b>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b style="white-space:nowrap">control operator</b></p></td>
<td><p>a <b>token</b> that performs a control function. It is one of the following symbols: <b>||</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, <b>;</b>, <b>;;</b>, <b>(</b>, <b>)</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>|&amp;</b>, or a newline.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2 id="reserved-words">Reserved words</h2>
<p class="tab"><i>Reserved words</i> are words that have special meaning to the shell. The following words are recognized as reserved when unquoted and either the first word or a simple command (see the "<a href="#shell-grammar">Shell Grammar</a>" section below), or the third word of a <b>case</b> or <b>for</b> command:</p>
<pre class="tab">!
case
do
done

esac
fi
for
function
if
in
select
then

while
{
}
time
[[
]]</pre>
<h2 id="shell-grammar">Shell grammar</h2>
<p class="tabb" id="7A1">Simple Commands</p>
<p class="tab">A <i>simple command</i> is an optional sequence of variable assignments followed by blank-separated words and redirections, and terminated by a control operator. The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero. The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.</p>
<p class="tab">The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or <b>128+n</b> if the command is terminated by signal <b>n</b>.</p>
<p class="tabb" id="pipelines">Pipelines</p>
<p class="tab">A <i>pipeline</i> is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators <b>|</b> or <b>|&amp;</b>. The format for a pipeline is:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">[ <b>time</b> [ <b>-p</b> ]] [ <b>!</b> ] <i>command</i> [[ <b>|</b> &#9130;  <b>|&amp;</b> ] <i>command2</i> ... ]</pre>
<p class="tab">The standard output of <b>command</b> is connected via a pipe to the standard input of <b>command2</b>. This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see the "<a href="#redirection">Redirection</a>" section below for details). If <b>|&amp;</b> is used, the standard error of <b>command</b> is connected to <b>command2</b>'s standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for <b>2&gt;&amp;1 |</b>. This implicit redirection of the standard error is performed after any redirections specified by the command.</p>
<p class="tab">The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command, unless the <b>pipefail</b> option is enabled. If <b>pipefail</b> is enabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully. If the reserved word <b>!</b> precedes a pipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical negation of the exit status as described above. The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.</p>
<p class="tab">If the <b>time</b> reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as user and system time consumed by its execution are reported when the pipeline terminates. The <b>-p</b> option changes the output format to that specified by POSIX. When the shell is in posix mode, it does not recognize <b>time</b> as a reserved word if the next token begins with a '<b>-</b>'. The <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> variable may be set to a format string that specifies how the timing information should be displayed; see the description of <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> in the "<a href="#shell-variables">Shell Variables</a>" section below for details.</p>
<p class="tab">When the shell is in posix mode, <b>time</b> may be followed by a newline. In this case, the shell displays the total user and system time consumed by the shell and its children. The <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> variable may be used to specify the format of the time information.</p>
<p class="tab">Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (a subshell).</p>
<p class="tabb" id="7A3">Lists</p>
<p class="tab">A <i>list</i> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, or <b>||</b>, and optionally terminated by one of <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, or <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">Of these list operators, <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> have equal precedence, followed by <b>;</b> and <b>&amp;</b>, which have equal precedence.</p>
<p class="tab">A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a list instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.</p>
<p class="tab">If a command is terminated by the control operator <b>&amp;</b>, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0. Commands separated by a <b>;</b> are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn. The return status is the exit status of the last command executed.</p>
<p class="tab"><b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b> lists are sequences of one of more pipelines separated by the <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> control operators, respectively. <b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b> lists are executed with left associativity. An <b>AND</b> list has the form</p>
<pre class="tab tcy"><i>command1</i> &amp;&amp; <i>command2</i></pre>
<p class="tab"><i>command2</i> is executed if, and only if, <i>command1</i> returns an exit status of zero.</p>
<p class="tab">An <b>OR</b> list has the form</p>
<pre class="tab tcy"><i>command1</i> || <i>command2</i></pre>
<p class="tab"><i>command2</i> is executed if and only if <i>command1</i> returns a non-zero exit status. The return status of <b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b> lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.</p>
<p class="tabb" id="compound-commands">Compound Commands</p>
<p class="tab">A <i>compound command</i> is one of the following:</p>
<table class="mtable3 tab">
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b></p></td>
<td><p><i>list</i> is executed in a subshell environment (see the "<a href="#command-execution-environment">Command Execution Environment</a>" section below for details). Variable assignments and builtin commands that affect the shell's environment do not remain in effect after the command completes. The return status is the exit status of list.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>{</b> <i>list</i><b>; }</b></p></td>
<td><p><i>list</i> is executed in the current shell environment. The <i>list</i> must be terminated with a newline or semicolon. This is known as a <i>group command</i>. The return status is the exit status of <i>list</i>. Note that unlike the metacharacters <b>(</b> and <b>)</b>, <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are reserved words and must occur where a reserved word is permitted to be recognized. Since they do not cause a word break, they must be separated from list by whitespace or another shell metacharacter.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">

<p class="tab">A "coprocess" is a shell command preceded by the <b>coproc</b> reserved word. A <b>coprocess</b> is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command had been terminated with the <b>&amp;</b> control operator, with a two-way pipe established between the executing shell and the coprocess.</p>
<p class="tab">The format for a coprocess is:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">coproc [<i>NAME</i>] <i>command</i> [<i>redirections</i>]</pre>
<p class="tab">This creates a coprocess named <i>NAME</i>. If <i>NAME</i> is not supplied, the default name is <b>COPROC</b>. The <i>NAME</i> must not be supplied if <i>command</i> is a simple command (see <a href="#7A1">above</a>); otherwise, it is interpreted as the first word of the simple command. When the <b>coproc</b> is executed, the shell creates an array variable (see the "<a href="#arrays">Arrays</a>" section below) named <i>NAME</i> in the context of the executing shell. The standard output of <i>command</i> is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to <i>NAME</i>[0]. The standard input of <i>command</i> is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to <i>NAME</i>[1]. This pipe is established before any redirections specified by the command (see the "<a href="#redirection">Redirection</a>" section below). The file descriptors can be utilized as arguments to shell commands and redirections using standard word expansions. The <a href="/jargon/p/pid.htm">process ID</a> of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is available as the value of the variable <b>NAME_PID</b>. The <a href="/unix/uwait.htm">wait</a> builtin command may be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.</p>

<pre class="tab tcy">name () <i>compound-command</i> [<i>redirection</i>]</pre>
<pre class="tab tcy">function name [()] <i>compound-command</i> [<i>redirection</i>]</pre>
<p class="tab">This defines a function named <i>name</i>. The reserved word <b>function</b> is optional. If the <b>function</b> reserved word is supplied, the parentheses are optional. The body of the function is the compound command <i>compound-command</i> (see "<a href="#compound-commands">Compound Commands</a>" section above). That command is usually a list of commands between <b>{</b> and <b>}</b>, but may be any command listed under Compound Commands above. The <b>compound-command</b> is executed whenever <i>name</i> is specified as the name of a simple command. Any redirections (see "<a href="#redirection">Redirection</a>" section below) specified when a function is defined are performed when the function is executed. The exit status of a function definition is zero unless a syntax error occurs or a readonly function with the same name already exists. When executed, the exit status of a function is the exit status of the last command executed in the body. See "<a href="#functions">Functions</a>" section below.</p>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p class="tab">In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the <b>interactive_comments</b> option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin is enabled (see "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" section below), a word beginning with <b>#</b> causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored. An interactive shell without the <b>interactive_comments</b> option enabled does not allow comments. The <b>interactive_comments</b> option is on by default in interactive shells.</p>
<h2 id="9A">Quoting</h2>
<p class="tab"><i>Quoting</i> is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell. Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.</p>
<p class="tab">Each of the metacharacters listed above under the "<a href="#5A">Definitions</a>" section has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.</p>
<p class="tab">When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see the "<a href="#history-expansion">History Expansion</a>" section below), the history expansion character, usually <b>!</b>, must be quoted to prevent history expansion.</p>
<p class="tab">There are three quoting mechanisms: the escape character, single quotes, and double quotes.</p>
<p class="tab">A non-quoted backslash (<b>\</b>) is the escape character. It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>. If a <b>\&lt;newline&gt;</b> pair appears, and the backslash is not itself quoted, the <b>\&lt;newline&gt;</b> is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).</p>
<p class="tab">Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.</p>
<p class="tab">Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of <b>$</b>, <b>&#96;</b>, <b>\</b>, and, when history expansion is enabled, <b>!</b>. The characters <b>$</b> and <b>&#96;</b> retain their special meaning within double quotes. The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: <b>$</b>, <b>&#96;</b>, <b>"</b>, <b>\</b>, or <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an <b>!</b> appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the <b>!</b> is not removed.</p>
<p class="tab">The special parameters <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> have special meaning when in double quotes (see the section "<a href="#parameters">Parameters</a>" below).</p>
<p class="tab" id="expand-string-interpret-escapes">Words of the form <b>$'string'</b> are treated specially. The word expands to string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the <a href="/jargon/a/ansi.htm">ANSI</a> C standard.

<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>
<p class="tab">A <i>parameter</i> is an entity that stores values. It can be a name, a number, or one of the special characters listed below under Special Parameters. A variable is a parameter denoted by a name. A variable has a value and zero or more attributes. Attributes are assigned using the <b>declare</b> builtin command (see <b>declare</b> below in the "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" section). A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value. The null string is a valid value. Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the <b>unset</b> builtin command (also documented in the "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" section).</p>
<p class="tab">A variable may be assigned by a statement of the form:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy"><i>name</i>=[<i>value</i>]</pre>
<p class="tab">If <i>value</i> is not given, the variable is assigned the null string. All values undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal (see the section "<a href="#expansion">Expansion</a>" below). If the variable has its integer attribute set, then value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the <b>$((...))</b> expansion is not used (see the section "<a href="#11A5">Arithmetic Expansion</a>" below). Word splitting is not performed, with the exception of "<b><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a98de9">[email&#160;protected]</a></b>" as explained below under <a href="#special-parameters">Special Parameters</a>. Pathname expansion is not performed. Assignment statements may also appear as arguments to the <b>alias</b>, <b>declare</b>, <b>typeset</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>readonly</b>, and <b>local</b> builtin commands.</p>
<p class="tab">In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index, the <b>+=</b> operator can be used to append to or add to the variable's previous value. When <b>+=</b> is applied to a variable for which the integer attribute has been set, <i>value</i> is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the variable's current value, which is also evaluated. When <b>+=</b> is applied to an array variable using compound assignment (see "<a href="#arrays">Arrays</a>" below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is when using <b>=</b>), and new values are appended to the array beginning at one greater than the array's maximum index (for indexed arrays) or added as additional key-value pairs in an associative array. When applied to a string-valued variable, value is expanded and appended to the variable's value.</p>
<p class="tabb" id="10A1">Positional parameters</p>
<p class="tab">A <i>positional parameter</i> is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other than the single digit 0. Positional parameters are assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may be reassigned using the <b>set</b> builtin command. Positional parameters may not be assigned to with assignment statements. The positional parameters are temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed (see the section "<a href="#functions">Functions</a>" below).</p>
<p class="tab">When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see the section "<a href="#expansion">Expansion</a>" below).</p>
<p class="tabb" id="special-parameters">Special parameters</p>
<p class="tab">The shell treats several parameters specially. These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.</p>
<table class="mtable3 tab">
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>*</b></p></td>
<td><p>Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the IFS special variable. That is, "<b>$*</b>" is equivalent to "<b>$1c$2c...</b>", where <b>c</b> is the first character of the value of the <b>IFS</b> variable. If IFS is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces. If IFS is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators. The <b>@</b> Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word. That is, "<b><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="301470">[email&#160;protected]</a></b>" is equivalent to "<b>$1</b>" "<b>$2</b>" ...

<td><p>This variable controls how the shell interacts with the user and job control. If this variable is set, single word simple commands without redirections are treated as candidates for resumption of an existing stopped job. There is no ambiguity allowed; if there is more than one job beginning with the string typed, the job most recently accessed is selected. The name of a stopped job, in this context, is the command line used to start it. If set to the value exact, the string supplied must match the name of a stopped job exactly; if set to substring, the string supplied needs to match a substring of the name of a stopped job. The substring value provides functionality analogous to the <b>%?</b> job identifier (see the section "<a href="#job-control">Job Control</a>" below). If set to any other value, the supplied string must be a prefix of a stopped job's name; this provides functionality analogous to the <b>%</b><i>string</i> job identifier.</p></td>

<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>histchars</b></p></td>
<td><p>The two or three characters which control history expansion and tokenization (see the section "<a href="#history-expansion">History Expansion</a>" below). The first character is the history expansion character, the character that signals the start of a history expansion, normally '<b>!</b>'. The second character is the quick substitution character, which is used as shorthand for re-running the previous command entered, substituting one string for another in the command. The default is '<b>^</b>'. The optional third character is the character that indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment when found as the first character of a word, normally '<b>#</b>'. The history comment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the remaining words on the line. It does not necessarily cause the shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.</p></td>

<h2 id="arrays">Arrays</h2>
<p class="tab">Bash provides one-dimensional indexed and associative <a href="/jargon/a/array.htm">array</a> variables. Any variable may be used as an indexed array; the <b>declare</b> builtin will explicitly declare an array. There is no maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously. Indexed arrays are referenced using integers (including arithmetic expressions) and are zero-based; associative arrays are referenced using arbitrary strings.</p>
<p class="tab">An indexed array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to using the syntax <i>name</i><b>[</b><i>subscript</i><b>]=</b><i>value</i>. The subscript is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number. If subscript evaluates to a number less than zero, it is used as an offset from one greater than the array's maximum index (so a subscript of <b>-1</b> refers to the last element of the array). To explicitly declare an indexed array, use declare <b>-a</b> name (see the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" below). <b>declare -a</b> <i>name</i><b>[</b><i>subscript</i><b>]</b> is also accepted; the subscript is ignored.</p>
<p class="tab">Associative arrays are created using declare <b>-A</b> name.</p>
<p class="tab">Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the <b>declare</b> and <b>readonly</b> builtins. Each attribute applies to all members of an array.</p>
<p class="tab">Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form <i>name</i><b>=(</b><i>value1</i> ... <i>valuen</i><b>)</b>, where each value is of the form <b>[</b><i>subscript</i><b>]=</b><i>string</i>. Indexed array assignments do not require the bracket and subscript. When assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned-to; otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last index assigned to by the statement plus one. Indexing starts at zero.</p>
<p class="tab">When assigning to an associative array, the subscript is required.</p>
<p class="tab">This syntax is also accepted by the <b>declare</b> builtin. Individual array elements may be assigned to using the <i>name</i><b>[</b><i>subscript</i><b>]=</b><i>value</i> syntax introduced above.</p>
<p class="tab" id="referencing-array-elements">Any element of an array may be referenced using <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[</b><i>subscript</i><b>]}</b>. The braces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion. If subscript is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the word expands to all members of name. These subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes. If the word is double-quoted, <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[*]}</b> expands to a single word with the value of each array member separated by the first character of the <b>IFS</b> special variable, and <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[@]}</b> expands each element of name to a separate word. When there are no array members, <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[@]}</b> expands to nothing. If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word. This is analogous to the expansion of the special parameters <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> (see the section "<a href="#special-parameters">Special Parameters</a>" above). <b>${#</b><i>name</i><b>[</b><i>subscript</i><b>]}</b> expands to the length of <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[</b><i>subscript</i><b>]}</b>. If <i>subscript</i> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, the expansion is the number of elements in the array. Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the array with a subscript of 0.</p>
<p class="tab">An array variable is considered set if a subscript has been assigned a value. The null string is a valid value.</p>
<p class="tab">The <b>unset</b> builtin is used to destroy arrays. <b>unset</b> <i>name</i><b>[</b><i>subscript</i><b>]</b> destroys the array element at index <i>subscript</i>. Care must be taken to avoid unwanted side effects caused by pathname expansion. <b>unset</b> <i>name</i>, where <i>name</i> is an array, or <b>unset</b> <i>name</i><b>[</b><i>subscript</i><b>]</b>, where <i>subscript</i> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, removes the entire array.</p>
<p class="tab">The <b>declare</b>, <b>local</b>, and <b>readonly</b> builtins each accept a <b>-a</b> option to specify an indexed array and a <b>-A</b> option to specify an associative array. If both options are supplied, <b>-A</b> takes precedence. The <b>read</b> builtin accepts a <b>-a</b> option to assign a list of words read from the standard input to an array. The <b>set</b> and <b>declare</b> builtins display array values in a way that allows them to be reused as assignments.</p>
<h2 id="expansion">Expansion</h2>
<p class="tab"><i>Expansion</i> is performed on the command line after it has been split into words. There are seven kinds of expansion performed: brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion.</p>
<p class="tab">The order of expansions is: brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter, variable and arithmetic expansion and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion), word splitting, and pathname expansion.</p>
<p class="tab">On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: process substitution.</p>
<p class="tab">Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can change the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single word. The only exceptions to this are the expansions of "<b><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5d791d">[email&#160;protected]</a></b>" and "<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[@]}</b>" as explained above (see the section "<a href="#parameters">Parameters</a>").</p>
<h2 id="11A1">Brace expansion</h2>
<p class="tab">Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated. This mechanism is similar to pathname expansion, but the filenames generated need not exist. Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional preamble, followed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces, followed by an optional postscript. The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right.</p>
<p class="tab">Brace expansions may be nested. The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved. For example, <b>a{d,c,b}e</b> expands into '<b>ade ace abe</b>'.</p>
<p class="tab">A sequence expression takes the form <b>{</b><i>x</i>..<i>y</i>[..<i>incr</i>]<b>}</b>, where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are either integers or single characters, and <i>incr</i>, an optional increment, is an integer. When integers are supplied, the expression expands to each number between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, inclusive. Supplied integers may be prefixed with 0 to force each term to have the same width. When either <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary. When characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character lexicographically between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, inclusive. Note that both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> must be of the same type. When the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term. The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.</p>
<p class="tab">Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result. It is strictly textual. Bash does not apply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.</p>
<p class="tab">A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression. Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged. A <b>{</b> or <b>,</b> may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered part of a brace expression. To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string <b>${</b> is not considered eligible for brace expansion.</p>
<p class="tab">This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}</pre>
<p class="tab">or</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}</pre>
<p class="tab">Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with historical versions of <a href="/unix/ush.htm"><b>sh</b></a>. <b>sh</b> does not treat opening or closing braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output. Bash removes braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion. For example, a word entered to sh as <b>file{1,2}</b> appears identically in the output. The same word is output as <b>file1 file2</b> after expansion by bash. If strict compatibility with <b>sh</b> is desired, start bash with the <b>+B</b> option or disable brace expansion with the <b>+B</b> option to the set command (see the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" below).</p>
<h2 id="tilde-expansion">Tilde expansion</h2>
<p class="tab">If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character ('<b>~</b>'), all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a tilde-prefix. If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible login name. If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the shell parameter <b>HOME</b>. If <b>HOME</b> is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory associated with the specified login name.</p>
<p class="tab">If the tilde-prefix is a '<b>~+</b>', the value of the shell variable <b>PWD</b> replaces the tilde-prefix. If the tilde-prefix is a '<b>~-</b>', the value of the shell variable <b>OLDPWD</b>, if it is set, is substituted. If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number <b>N</b>, optionally prefixed by a '<b>+</b>' or a '<b>-</b>', the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would be displayed by the <b>dirs</b> builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix as an argument. If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading '<b>+</b>' or '<b>-</b>', '<b>+</b>' is assumed.</p>
<p class="tab">If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is unchanged.</p>
<p class="tab">Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immediately following a <b>:</b> or the first <b>=</b>. In these cases, tilde expansion is also performed. Consequently, one may use file names with tildes in assignments to <b>PATH</b>, <b>MAILPATH</b>, and <b>CDPATH</b>, and the shell assigns the expanded value.</p>
<h2 id="parameter-expansion">Parameter expansion</h2>
<p class="tab">The '<b>$</b>' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion. The parameter name or symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect the variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which could be interpreted as part of the name.</p>
<p class="tab">When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first '<b>}</b>' not escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter expansion.</p>
<p class="tab"><span class="tips">Quick reference:</span> Here is table briefly describing each bash parameter expansion form, and how it behaves depending on the value of <i>parameter</i>.</p>

<p class="tab">As you can see, if the expansion form includes a colon ("<b>:</b>"), there is an alternate behavior when <i>parameter</i> is set, but its value is Null (which is equivalent to the single-quoted empty string, <b>''</b>). If <i>parameter</i> is not set at all, behavior is the same with or without a colon.</p>
<p class="tab">The following descriptions go into a bit more detail:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Here, the value of <i>parameter</i> is substituted. The braces are required when <i>parameter</i> is a positional parameter with more than one digit, or when <i>parameter</i> is followed by a character that is not to be interpreted as part of its name.</p>
<p class="tab" id="variable-indirection">If the first character of <i>parameter</i> is an exclamation point (<b>!</b>), a level of variable indirection is introduced. Bash uses the value of the variable formed from the rest of <i>parameter</i> as the name of the variable; this variable is then expanded and that value is used in the rest of the substitution, rather than the value of <i>parameter</i> itself. This is known as <b>indirect expansion</b>. The exceptions to this are the expansions of <b>${!</b><i>prefix</i><b>*}</b> and <b>${!</b><i>name</i><b>[@]}</b> described below. The exclamation point must immediately follow the left brace to introduce indirection.</p>
<p class="tab">In each of the cases below, <i>word</i> is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.</p>
<p class="tab">When not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented below, bash tests for a parameter that is unset or null. Omitting the colon results in a test only for a parameter that is unset, bypassing the test if the parameter is null.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>:-<i>word</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Use Default Values. If <i>parameter</i> is unset or null, the expansion of <i>word</i> is substituted. Otherwise, the value of <i>parameter</i> is substituted.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>:=<i>word</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Assign Default Values. If <i>parameter</i> is unset or null, the expansion of <i>word</i> is assigned to <i>parameter</i>. The value of <i>parameter</i> is then substituted. Positional parameters and special parameters may not be assigned to in this way.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>:?<i>word</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Display Error if Null or Unset. If <i>parameter</i> is null or unset, the expansion of <i>word</i> (or a message to that effect if <i>word</i> is not present) is written to the standard error and the shell, if it is not interactive, exits. Otherwise, the value of <i>parameter</i> is substituted.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy" id="expansion-with-alternate-value">${<i>parameter</i>:+<i>word</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Use Alternate Value. If <i>parameter</i> is null or unset, nothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of <i>word</i> is substituted.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>:<i>offset</i>}</pre>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>:<i>offset</i>:<i>length</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Substring Expansion. Expands to up to <i>length</i> characters of <i>parameter</i> starting at the character specified by <i>offset</i>. If <i>length</i> is omitted, expands to the substring of <i>parameter</i> starting at the character specified by <i>offset</i>. The <i>length</i> and <i>offset</i> are arithmetic expressions (see the section "<a href="#15A">Arithmetic Evaluation</a>" below). If <i>offset</i> evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used as an offset from the end of the value of <i>parameter</i>. Arithmetic expressions starting with a <b>-</b> must be separated by whitespace from the preceding <b>:</b> to be distinguished from the Use Default Values expansion. If length evaluates to a number less than zero, and parameter is not <b>@</b> and not an indexed or associative array, it is interpreted as an offset from the end of the value of parameter rather than a number of characters, and the expansion is the characters between the two offsets. If <i>parameter</i> is <b>@</b>, the result is <i>length</i> positional parameters beginning at <i>offset</i>. If <i>parameter</i> is an indexed array name subscripted by <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the result is the <i>length</i> members of the array beginning with <b>${</b><i>parameter</i>[<i>offset</i>]<b>}</b>. A negative offset is taken relative to one greater than the maximum index of the specified array. Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces undefined results. Note that a negative offset must be separated from the colon by at least one space to avoid being confused with the <b>:-</b> expansion. Substring indexing is zero-based unless the positional parameters are used, in which case the indexing starts at 1 by default. If offset is 0, and the positional parameters are used, <b>$0</b> is prefixed to the list.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${!<i>prefix</i>*}</pre>
<pre class="tab tcy">${!<i>prefix</i>@}</pre>
<p class="tab">Names matching <i>prefix</i>. Expands to the names of variables whose names begin with <i>prefix</i>, separated by the first character of the <b>IFS</b> special variable. When <b>@</b> is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each variable name expands to a separate word.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${!<i>name</i>[@]}</pre>
<pre class="tab tcy">${!<i>name</i>[*]}</pre>
<p class="tab">List of array keys. If <i>name</i> is an array variable, expands to the list of array indices (keys) assigned in name. If <i>name</i> is not an array, expands to 0 if name is set and null otherwise. When <b>@</b> is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each key expands to a separate word.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${#<i>parameter</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Parameter length. The length in characters of the value of <i>parameter</i> is substituted. If parameter is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, the value substituted is the number of positional parameters. If <i>parameter</i> is an array name subscripted by <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, the value substituted is the number of elements in the array.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>#<i>word</i>}</pre>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>##<i>word</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Remove matching prefix pattern. The <i>word</i> is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion. If the pattern matches the beginning of the value of <i>parameter</i>, then the result of the expansion is the expanded value of parameter with the shortest matching pattern (the "<b>#</b>" case) or the longest matching pattern (the "<b>##</b>" case) deleted. If parameter is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the pattern removal operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If parameter is an array variable subscripted with <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>%<i>word</i>}</pre>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>%%<i>word</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Remove matching suffix pattern. The <i>word</i> is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion. If the pattern matches a trailing portion of the expanded value of <i>parameter</i>, then the result of the expansion is the expanded value of <i>parameter</i> with the shortest matching pattern (the "<b>%</b>" case) or the longest matching pattern (the "<b>%%</b>" case) deleted. If parameter is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the pattern removal operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If parameter is an array variable subscripted with <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>/<i>pattern</i>/<i>string</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Pattern substitution. The <i>pattern</i> is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion. The <i>Parameter</i> is expanded and the longest match of <i>pattern</i> against its value is replaced with string. If <i>pattern</i> begins with <b>/</b>, all matches of <i>pattern</i> are replaced with <i>string</i>. Normally only the first match is replaced. If <i>pattern</i> begins with <b>#</b>, it must match at the beginning of the expanded value of <i>parameter</i>. If <i>pattern</i> begins with <b>%</b>, it must match at the end of the expanded value of <i>parameter</i>. If <i>string</i> is null, matches of <i>pattern</i> are deleted and the <b>/</b> following pattern may be omitted. If <i>parameter</i> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the substitution operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If <i>parameter</i> is an array variable subscripted with <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the substitution operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>^<i>pattern</i>}</pre>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>^^<i>pattern</i>}</pre>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>,<i>pattern</i>}</pre>
<pre class="tab tcy">${<i>parameter</i>,,<i>pattern</i>}</pre>
<p class="tab">Case modification. This expansion modifies the case of alphabetic characters in <i>parameter</i>. The <i>pattern</i> is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion. The <b>^</b> operator converts lowercase letters matching pattern to uppercase; the <b>,</b> operator converts matching uppercase letters to lowercase. The <b>^^</b> and <b>,,</b> expansions convert each matched character in the expanded value; the <b>^</b> and <b>,</b> expansions match and convert only the first character in the expanded value. If <i>pattern</i> is omitted, it is treated like a <b>?</b>, which matches every character. If <i>parameter</i> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the case modification operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If parameter is an array variable subscripted with <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the case modification operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.</p>
<h2 id="command-substitution">Command substitution</h2>
<p class="tab"><i>Command substitution</i> allows the output of a command to replace the command name. There are two forms:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">$(<i>command</i>)</pre>
<p class="tab">or</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">&#96;<i>command</i>&#96;</pre>
<p class="tab">Bash performs the expansion by executing <i>command</i> and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. Embedded newlines are not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting. The command substitution <b>$(cat file)</b> can be replaced by the equivalent but faster <b>$(&lt; file)</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used, backslash retains its literal meaning except when followed by <b>$</b>, <b>&#96;</b>, or <b>\</b>. The first backquote not preceded by a backslash terminates the command substitution. When using the <b>$(</b><i>command</i><b>)</b> form, all characters between the parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially.</p>
<p class="tab">Command substitutions may be nested. To nest when using the backquoted form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.</p>
<p class="tab">If the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the results.</p>
<h2 id="11A5">Arithmetic expansion</h2>
<p class="tab"><i>Arithmetic expansion</i> allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result. The format for arithmetic expansion is:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">$((<i>expression</i>))</pre>
<p class="tab">The old format <b>$[</b><i>expression</i><b>]</b> is deprecated and will be removed in upcoming versions of bash.</p>
<p class="tab">The <i>expression</i> is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a double quote inside the parentheses is not treated specially. All tokens in the expression undergo parameter expansion, string expansion, command substitution, and quote removal. Arithmetic expansions may be nested.</p>
<p class="tab">The evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below under the section "<a href="#15A">Arithmetic Evaluation</a>." If <i>expression</i> is invalid, bash prints a message indicating failure and no substitution occurs.</p>
<h2 id="process-substitution">Process substitution</h2>
<p class="tab">Process substitution is supported on systems that support named pipes (<a href="/jargon/f/fifo.htm">FIFO</a>s) or the <b>/dev/fd</b> method of naming open files. It takes the form of <b>&lt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b> or <b>&gt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b>. The process <i>list</i> is run with its input or output connected to a FIFO or some file in <b>/dev/fd</b>. The name of this file is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion. If the <b>&gt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b> form is used, writing to the file will provide input for list. If the <b>&lt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b> form is used, the file passed as an argument should be read to obtain the output of list.</p>
<p class="tab">When available, process substitution is performed simultaneously with parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.</p>
<h2 id="word-splitting">Word splitting</h2>
<p class="tab">The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes for word splitting.</p>
<p class="tab">The shell treats each character of <b>IFS</b> as a <a href="/jargon/d/delimite.htm">delimiter</a>, and splits the results of the other expansions into words on these characters. If <b>IFS</b> is unset, or its value is exactly <b>&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</b>, the default, then sequences of <b>&lt;space&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;tab&gt;</b>, and <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b> at the beginning and end of the results of the previous expansions are ignored, and any sequence of IFS characters not at the beginning or end serves to delimit words. If IFS has a value other than the default, then sequences of the whitespace characters space and tab are ignored at the beginning and end of the word, as long as the whitespace character is in the value of IFS (an IFS whitespace character). Any character in IFS that is not IFS whitespace, along with any adjacent IFS whitespace characters, delimits a field. A sequence of IFS whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter. If the value of IFS is null, no word splitting occurs.</p>
<p class="tab">Explicit null arguments (<b>""</b> or <b>''</b>) are retained. Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the expansion of parameters that have no values, are removed. If a parameter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a null argument results and is retained.</p>
<p class="tab">Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.</p>
<h2 id="pathname-expansion">Pathname expansion</h2>
<p class="tab">After word splitting, unless the <b>-f</b> option has been set, bash scans each word for the characters <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, and <b>[</b>. If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a pattern, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of file names matching the pattern. If no matching file names are found, and the shell option <b>nullglob</b> is not enabled, the word is left unchanged. If the <b>nullglob</b> option is set, and no matches are found, the word is removed. If the <b>failglob</b> shell option is set, and no matches are found, an error message is printed and the command is not executed. If the shell option <b>nocaseglob</b> is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. Note that when using range expressions like <b>[a-z]</b> (see the next section, "<a href="#11A10">Pattern Matching</a>"), letters of the other case may be included, depending on the setting of <b>LC_COLLATE</b>. When a pattern is used for pathname expansion, the character "<b>.</b>" at the start of a name or immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option <b>dotglob</b> is set. When matching a pathname, the slash character must always be matched explicitly. In other cases, the "<b>.</b>" character is not treated specially. See the description of <b>shopt</b> below under the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" for a description of the <b>nocaseglob</b>, <b>nullglob</b>, <b>failglob</b>, and <b>dotglob</b> shell options.</p>
<p class="tab">The <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> shell variable may be used to restrict the set of file names matching a pattern. If <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> is set, each matching file name that also matches one of the patterns in <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> is removed from the list of matches. The file names "<b>.</b>" and "<b>..</b> are always ignored when <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> is set and not null. However, setting <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> to a non-null value has the effect of enabling the <b>dotglob</b> shell option, so all other file names beginning with a "<b>.</b>" will match. To get the old behavior of ignoring file names beginning with a "<b>.</b>", make "<b>.*</b>" one of the patterns in <b>GLOBIGNORE</b>. The <b>dotglob</b> option is disabled when <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> is unset.</p>
<h2 id="11A10">Pattern matching</h2>
<p class="tab">Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern characters described below, matches itself. The <b>NUL</b> character may not occur in a pattern. A backslash escapes the following character; the escaping backslash is discarded when matching. The special pattern characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.</p>
<p class="tab">The special pattern characters have the following meanings:</p>
<table class="mtable3 tab">
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>*</b></p></td>
<td><p>Matches any string, including the null string. When the <b>globstar</b> shell option is enabled, and <b>*</b> is used in a pathname expansion context, two adjacent <b>*</b>s used as a single pattern will match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If followed by a <b>/</b>, two adjacent <b>*</b>s will match only directories and subdirectories.</p></td>

<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>?</b></p></td>
<td><p>Matches any single character.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>[...]</b></p></td>
<td><p>Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of characters separated by a hyphen denotes a range expression; any character that sorts between those two characters, inclusive, using the current locale's collating sequence and character set, is matched. If the first character following the <b>[</b> is a <b>!</b> or a <b>^</b> then any character not enclosed is matched. The sorting order of characters in range expressions is determined by the current locale and the value of the <b>LC_COLLATE</b> shell variable, if set. A <b>-</b> may be matched by including it as the first or last character in the set. A <b>]</b> may be matched by including it as the first character in the set.</p>
<p>Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, character classes can be specified using the syntax <b>[:</b><i>class</i><b>:]</b>, where <i>class</i> is one of the following classes defined in the POSIX standard:</p>
<p><b>alnum alpha ascii blank cntrl digit graph lower print punct space upper word xdigit</b></p>
<p>A character class matches any character belonging to that class. The word character class matches letters, digits, and the character <b>_</b>.</p>
<p>Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, an equivalence class can be specified using the syntax <b>[=c=]</b>, which matches all characters with the same collation weight (as defined by the current locale) as the character <b>c</b>.</p>
<p>Within <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>, the syntax <b>[.</b><i>symbol</i><b>.]</b> matches the collating symbol <i>symbol</i>.</p>

<p class="tab">After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters <b>\</b>, <b>'</b>, and <b>"</b> that did not result from one of the above expansions are removed.</p>
<h2 id="redirection">Redirection</h2>
<p class="tab">Before a command is executed, its input and output may be <i>redirected</i> using a special notation interpreted by the shell. Redirection may also be used to open and close files for the current shell execution environment. The following redirection operators may precede or appear anywhere within a simple command or may follow a command. Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from left to right.</p>
<p class="tab">Each redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number may instead be preceded by a word of the form <b>{</b><i>varname</i><b>}</b>. In this case, for each redirection operator except <b>&gt;&amp;-</b> and <b>&lt;&amp;-</b>, the shell will allocate a file descriptor greater than 10 and assign it to <i>varname</i>. If <b>&gt;&amp;-</b> or <b>&lt;&amp;-</b> is preceded by <b>{</b><i>varname</i><b>}</b>, the value of <i>varname</i> defines the file descriptor to close.</p>
<p class="tab">In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is <b>&lt;</b>, the redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0). If the first character of the redirection operator is <b>&gt;</b>, the redirection refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).</p>
<p class="tab">The word following the redirection operator in the following descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion, and word splitting. If it expands to more than one word, bash reports an error.</p>
<p class="tab">Note that the order of redirections is significant. For example, the command</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">ls &gt; dirlist 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>
<p class="tab">directs both standard output and standard error to the file <b>dirlist</b>, while the command</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">ls 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; dirlist</pre>
<p class="tab">directs only the standard output to file <b>dirlist</b>, because the standard error was duplicated from the standard output before the standard output was redirected to <b>dirlist</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">Bash handles several filenames specially when they are used in redirections, as described in the following table:</p>
<table class="mtable3 tab">
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>/dev/fd/fd</b></p></td>
<td><p>If <b>fd</b> is a valid integer, file descriptor <b>fd</b> is duplicated.</p></td>

<h2 id="12A1">Redirecting input</h2>
<p class="tab">Redirection of input causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <i>word</i> to be opened for reading on file descriptor <i>n</i>, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if <i>n</i> is not specified.</p>
<p class="tab">The general format for redirecting input is:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">[<i>n</i>]&lt;<i>word</i></pre>
<h2 id="12A2">Redirecting output</h2>
<p class="tab">Redirection of output causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <i>word</i> to be opened for writing on file descriptor <i>n</i>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <i>n</i> is not specified. If the file does not exist it is created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size.</p>
<p class="tab">The general format for redirecting output is:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">[<i>n</i>]&gt;<i>word</i></pre>
<p class="tab">If the redirection operator is <b>&gt;</b>, and the <b>noclobber</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin has been enabled, the redirection will fail if the file whose name results from the expansion of <i>word</i> exists and is a regular file. If the redirection operator is <b>&gt;|</b>, or the redirection operator is <b>&gt;</b> and the <b>noclobber</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin command is not enabled, the redirection is attempted even if the file named by word exists.</p>
<h2 id="12A3">Appending redirected output</h2>
<p class="tab">Redirection of output in this fashion causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <i>word</i> to be opened for appending on file descriptor <i>n</i>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <i>n</i> is not specified. If the file does not exist it is created.</p>
<p class="tab">The general format for appending output is:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">[<i>n</i>]&gt;&gt;<i>word</i></pre>
<h2 id="12A4">Redirecting standard output and standard error</h2>
<p class="tab">This construct allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be redirected to the file whose name is the expansion of <i>word</i>.</p>
<p class="tab">There are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard error:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">&amp;&gt;<i>word</i></pre>
<p class="tab">and</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">&gt;&amp;<i>word</i></pre>
<p class="tab">Of the two forms, the first is preferred. This is semantically equivalent to</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">&gt;<i>word</i> 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>
<h2 id="12A6">Appending standard output and standard error</h2>
<p class="tab">This construct allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be appended to the file whose name is the expansion of <i>word</i>.</p>
<p class="tab">The format for appending standard output and standard error is:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">&amp;&gt;&gt;<i>word</i></pre>
<p class="tab">This is semantically equivalent to</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">&gt;&gt;<i>word</i> 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>
<h2 id="12A7">Here documents</h2>
<p class="tab">This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only delimiter (with no trailing blanks) is seen. All of the lines read up to that point are then used as the standard input for a command.</p>
<p class="tab">The format of here-documents is:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">&lt;&lt;[-]<i>word</i> <i>here-document</i> <i>delimiter</i></pre>
<p class="tab">No parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or pathname expansion is performed on word. If any characters in word are quoted, the delimiter is the result of quote removal on word, and the lines in the here-document are not expanded. If word is unquoted, all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. In the latter case, the character sequence <b>\&lt;newline&gt;</b> is ignored, and <b>\</b> must be used to quote the characters <b>\</b>, <b>$</b>, and <b>&#96;</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">If the redirection operator is <b>&lt;&lt;-</b>, then all leading tab characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing delimiter. This allows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a natural fashion.</p>
<h2 id="12A8">Here strings</h2>
<p class="tab">A variant of here documents, the format is:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">&lt;&lt;&lt;<i>word</i></pre>
<p class="tab">The word is expanded and supplied to the command on its standard input.</p>
<h2 id="12A9">Duplicating file descriptors</h2>
<p class="tab">The redirection operator</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">[<i>n</i>]&lt;&amp;<i>word</i></pre>
<p class="tab">is used to duplicate input file descriptors. If <i>word</i> expands to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by <i>n</i> is made to be a copy of that file descriptor. If the digits in word do not specify a file descriptor open for input, a redirection error occurs. If <i>word</i> evaluates to <b>-</b>, file descriptor <i>n</i> is closed. If <i>n</i> is not specified, the standard input (file descriptor 0) is used.</p>
<p class="tab">The operator</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">[<i>n</i>]&gt;&amp;<i>word</i></pre>
<p class="tab">is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors. If <i>n</i> is not specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1) is used. If the digits in <i>word</i> do not specify a file descriptor open for output, a redirection error occurs. As a special case, if <i>n</i> is omitted, and word does not expand to one or more digits, the standard output and standard error are redirected as described previously.</p>
<h2 id="12A10">Moving file descriptors</h2>
<p class="tab">The redirection operator</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">[<i>n</i>]&lt;&amp;<i>digit</i>-</pre>
<p class="tab">moves the file descriptor <i>digit</i> to file descriptor <i>n</i>, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if <i>n</i> is not specified. The <i>digit</i> is closed after being duplicated to <i>n</i>.</p>
<p class="tab">Similarly, the redirection operator</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">[<i>n</i>]&gt;&amp;<i>digit</i>-</pre>
<p class="tab">moves the file descriptor digit to file descriptor <i>n</i>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <i>n</i> is not specified.</p>
<h2 id="opening-file-descriptors">Opening file descriptors for reading and writing</h2>
<p class="tab">The redirection operator</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">[<i>n</i>]&lt;&gt;<i>word</i></pre>
<p class="tab">causes the file whose name is the expansion of <i>word</i> to be opened for both reading and writing on file descriptor <i>n</i>, or on file descriptor 0 if <i>n</i> is not specified. If the file does not exist, it is created.</p>
<h2 id="aliases">Aliases</h2>
<p class="tab"><i>Aliases</i> allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command. The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be set and unset with the <b>alias</b> and <b>unalias</b> builtin commands (see the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" for details). The first word of each simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias. If so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias. The characters <b>/</b>, <b>$</b>, <b>&#96;</b>, and <b>=</b> and any of the shell metacharacters or quoting characters listed above may not appear in an alias name. The replacement text may contain any valid shell input, including shell metacharacters. The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second time. This means that one may alias <b>ls</b> to <b>ls -F</b>, for instance, and bash does not try to recursively expand the replacement text. If the last character of the alias value is a blank, then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.</p>
<p class="tab">Aliases are created and listed with the <b>alias</b> command, and removed with the <b>unalias</b> command.</p>
<p class="tab">There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text. If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used (see the section "<a href="#functions">Functions</a>" below).</p>
<p class="tab">Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the <b>expand_aliases</b> shell option is set using <b>shopt</b> (see the description of <b>shopt</b> under the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" below).</p>
<p class="tab">The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confusing. Bash always reads at least one complete line of input before executing any of the commands on that line. Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when it is executed. Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take effect until the next line of input is read. The commands following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias. This behavior is also an issue when functions are executed. Aliases are expanded when a function definition is read, not when the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a compound command. As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until after that function is executed. To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use alias in compound commands.</p>
<p class="tab">For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p class="tab">A <i>shell function</i>, defined as described above under the section "<a href="#shell-grammar">Shell Grammar</a>", stores a series of commands for later execution. When the name of a shell function is used as a simple command name, the list of commands associated with that function name is executed. Functions are executed in the context of the current shell; no new process is created to interpret them (contrast this with the execution of a shell script). When a function is executed, the arguments to the function become the positional parameters during its execution. The special parameter <b>#</b> is updated to reflect the change. Special parameter 0 is unchanged. The first element of the <b>FUNCNAME</b> variable is set to the name of the function while the function is executing.</p>
<p class="tab">All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical between a function and its caller with these exceptions: the <b>DEBUG</b> and <b>RETURN</b> traps (see the description of the <b>trap</b> builtin under the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" below) are not inherited unless the function has been given the <b>trace</b> attribute (see the description of the <b>declare</b> builtin below) or the <b>-o functrace</b> shell option has been enabled with the <b>set</b> builtin (in which case all functions inherit the <b>DEBUG</b> and <b>RETURN</b> traps), and the <b>ERR</b> trap is not inherited unless the <b>-o errtrace</b> shell option has been enabled.</p>
<p class="tab">Variables local to the function may be declared with the <b>local</b> builtin command. Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the function and its caller.</p>
<p class="tab">The <b>FUNCNEST</b> variable, if set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level. Function invocations that exceed the limit cause the entire command to abort.</p>
<p class="tab">If the builtin command <b>return</b> is executed in a function, the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function call. Any command associated with the <b>RETURN</b> trap is executed before execution resumes. When a function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parameter <b>#</b> are restored to the values they had before the function's execution.</p>
<p class="tab">Function names and definitions may be listed with the <b>-f</b> option to the <b>declare</b> or <b>typeset</b> builtin commands. The <b>-F</b> option to <b>declare</b> or <b>typeset</b> will list the function names only (and optionally the source file and line number, if the <b>extdebug</b> shell option is enabled). Functions may be exported so that subshells automatically have them defined with the <b>-f</b> option to the <b>export</b> builtin. A function definition may be deleted using the <b>-f</b> option to the <b>unset</b> builtin. Note that shell functions and variables with the same name may result in multiple identically-named entries in the environment passed to the shell's children. Care should be taken in cases where this may cause a problem.</p>
<p class="tab">Functions may be recursive. The <b>FUNCNEST</b> variable may be used to limit the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number of function invocations. By default, no limit is imposed on the number of recursive calls.</p>
<h2 id="15A">Arithmetic evaluation</h2>
<p class="tab">The shell allows <i>arithmetic expressions</i> to be <i>evaluated</i>, under certain circumstances (see the <b>let</b> and <b>declare</b> builtin commands and the section "<a href="#11A5">Arithmetic Expansion</a>"). Evaluation is done in fixed-width integers with no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error. The operators and their precedence, associativity, and values are the same as in the <a href="/jargon/c/c.htm">C language</a>. The following list of operators is grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators. The levels are listed in order of decreasing precedence.</p>

<p class="tab">Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed before the expression is evaluated. Within an expression, shell variables may also be referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax. A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax. The value of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when it is referenced, or when a variable which has been given the integer attribute using <b>declare -i</b> is assigned a value. A null value evaluates to 0. A shell variable need not have its integer attribute turned on to be used in an expression.</p>
<p class="tab">Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers. A leading <b>0x</b> or <b>0X</b> denotes hexadecimal. Otherwise, numbers take the form <b>[base#]n</b>, where the optional base is a decimal number between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and <b>n</b> is a number in that base. If <b>base#</b> is omitted, then base 10 is used. The digits greater than 9 are represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, <b>@</b>, and <b>_</b>, in that order. If base is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35.</p>
<p class="tab">Operators are evaluated in order of precedence. Sub-expressions in parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules above.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-expressions">Conditional expressions</h2>
<p class="tab">Conditional expressions are used by the <b>[[</b> compound command and the <b>test</b> and <b>[</b> builtin commands to test file attributes and perform string and arithmetic comparisons. Expressions are formed from the following unary or binary primaries. If any file argument to one of the primaries is of the form <b>/dev/fd/n</b>, then file descriptor <b>n</b> is checked. If the file argument to one of the primaries is one of <b>/dev/stdin</b>, <b>/dev/stdout</b>, or <b>/dev/stderr</b>, file descriptor 0, 1, or 2, respectively, is checked.</p>

<h2 id="17A">Simple command expansion</h2>
<p class="tab">When a <i>simple command</i> is executed, the shell performs the following expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right.</p>
<ol>
<li>The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for later processing.</li>
<li>The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded. If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the name of the command and the remaining words are the arguments.</li>
<li>Redirections are performed as described above under REDIRECTION.</li>
<li>The text after the = in each variable assignment undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the variable.</li>
</ol>
<p class="tab">If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current shell environment. Otherwise, the variables are added to the environment of the executed command and do not affect the current shell environment. If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a readonly variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero status.</p>
<p class="tab">If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not affect the current shell environment. A redirection error causes the command to exit with a non-zero status.</p>
<p class="tab">If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as described below. Otherwise, the command exits. If one of the expansions contained a command substitution, the exit status of the command is the exit status of the last command substitution performed. If there were no command substitutions, the command exits with a status of zero.</p>
<h2 id="18A">Command execution</h2>
<p class="tab">After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.</p>
<p class="tab">If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked as described above in the section "<a href="#functions">Functions</a>." If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.</p>
<p class="tab">If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, bash searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name. Bash uses a hash table to remember the full pathnames of executable files (see <b>hash</b> under the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" below). A full search of the directories in PATH is performed only if the command is not found in the hash table. If the search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a defined shell function named <b>command_not_found_handle</b>. If that function exists, it is invoked with the original command and the original command's arguments as its arguments, and the function's exit status becomes the exit status of the shell. If that function is not defined, the shell prints an error message and returns an exit status of 127.</p>
<p class="tab">If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate execution environment. Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.</p>
<p class="tab">If this execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell script, a file containing shell commands. A subshell is spawned to execute it. This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent (see <b>hash</b> below under the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>") are retained by the child.</p>
<p class="tab">If the program is a file beginning with <b>#!</b>, the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program. The shell executes the specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this executable format themselves. The arguments to the interpreter consist of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the first line of the program, followed by the name of the program, followed by the command arguments, if any.</p>
<h2 id="command-execution-environment">Command execution environment</h2>
<p class="tab">The shell has an <i>execution environment</i>, which consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by redirections supplied to the <b>exec</b> builtin</li>
<li>the current working directory as set by <b>cd</b>, <b>pushd</b>, or <b>popd</b>, or inherited by the shell at invocation</li>
<li>the file creation mode mask as set by <a href="/unix/uumask.htm">umask</a> or inherited from the shell's parent</li>
<li>current traps set by <b>trap</b></li>
<li>shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with set or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment</li>
<li>shell functions defined during execution or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment</li>
<li>options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-line arguments) or by <b>set</b></li>
<li>options enabled by <b>shopt</b></li>
<li>shell aliases defined with <b>alias</b></li>
<li>various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the value of <b>$$</b>, and the value of <b>PPID</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="tab">When a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to be executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment that consists of the following. Unless otherwise noted, the values are inherited from the shell.</p>
<ul>
<li>the shell's open files, plus any modifications and additions specified by redirections to the command</li>
<li>the current working directory</li>
<li>the file creation mode mask</li>
<li>shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables exported for the command, passed in the environment</li>
<li>traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from the shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored</li>
</ul>
<p class="tab">A command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.</p>
<p class="tab" id="command-execution-environment-subshell">Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and asynchronous commands are invoked in a subshell environment that is a duplicate of the shell environment, except that traps caught by the shell are reset to the values that the shell inherited from its parent at invocation. Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline are also executed in a subshell environment. Changes made to the subshell environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.</p>
<p class="tab">Subshells spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of the <b>-e</b> option from the parent shell. When not in posix mode, bash clears the <b>-e</b> option in such subshells.</p>
<p class="tab">If a command is followed by a <b>&amp;</b> and job control is not active, the default standard input for the command is the empty file <b>/dev/null</b>. Otherwise, the invoked command inherits the file descriptors of the calling shell as modified by redirections.</p>
<h2 id="20A">Environment</h2>
<p class="tab">When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the <i>environment</i>. This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form <b>name=value</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment. On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found, automatically marking it for export to child processes. Executed commands inherit the environment. The <b>export</b> and <b>declare -x</b> commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and deleted from the environment. If the value of a parameter in the environment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, replacing the old. The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the unset command, plus any additions via the <b>export</b> and <b>declare -x</b> commands.</p>
<p class="tab">The environment for any simple command or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as described above in the section "<a href="#parameters">Parameters</a>." These assignment statements affect only the environment seen by that command.</p>
<p class="tab">If the <b>-k</b> option is set (see the <b>set</b> builtin command below), then all parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name.</p>
<p class="tab">When <b>bash</b> invokes an external command, the variable <b>_</b> is set to the full file name of the command and passed to that command in its environment.</p>
<h2 id="21A">Exit Status</h2>
<p class="tab">The <i>exit status</i> of an executed command is the value returned by the <b>waitpid</b> system call or equivalent function. Exit statuses fall between 0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell may use values above 125 specially. Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands are also limited to this range. Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special values to indicate specific failure modes.</p>
<p class="tab">For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. An exit status of zero indicates success. A non-zero exit status indicates failure. When a command terminates on a fatal signal <b>N</b>, bash uses the value of <b>128+N</b> as the exit status.</p>
<p class="tab">If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127. If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.</p>
<p class="tab">If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status is greater than zero.</p>
<p class="tab">Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (true) if successful, and non-zero (false) if an error occurs while they execute. All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage.</p>
<p class="tab">Bash itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value. See also the exit builtin command below.</p>
<h2 id="signals">Signals</h2>
<p class="tab">When bash is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores <b>SIGTERM</b> (so that kill 0 does not kill an interactive shell), and <b>SIGINT</b> is caught and handled (so that the wait builtin is interruptible). In all cases, bash ignores <b>SIGQUIT</b>. If job control is in effect, bash ignores <b>SIGTTIN</b>, <b>SIGTTOU</b>, and <b>SIGTSTP</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">Non-builtin commands run by bash have signal handlers set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent. When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore <b>SIGINT</b> and <b>SIGQUIT</b> in addition to these inherited handlers. Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals <b>SIGTTIN</b>, <b>SIGTTOU</b>, and <b>SIGTSTP</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">The shell exits by default upon receipt of a <b>SIGHUP</b>. Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the <b>SIGHUP</b> to all jobs, running or stopped. Stopped jobs are sent <b>SIGCONT</b> to ensure that they receive the <b>SIGHUP</b>. To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular job, it should be removed from the jobs table with the <b>disown</b> builtin (see the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" below) or marked to not receive <b>SIGHUP</b> using <b>disown -h</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">If the <b>huponexit</b> shell option has been set with <b>shopt</b>, bash sends a <b>SIGHUP</b> to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.</p>
<p class="tab">If bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until the command completes. When bash is waiting for an asynchronous command via the <b>wait</b> builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the wait builtin to return immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is executed.</p>
<h2 id="job-control">Job control</h2>
<p class="tab"><i>Job control</i> refers to the ability to selectively stop (suspend) the execution of processes and continue (resume) their execution at a later point. A user typically employs this facility via an interactive interface supplied jointly by the operating system <a href="/jargon/k/kernel.htm">kernel</a>'s terminal driver and bash.</p>
<p class="tab">The shell associates a job with each pipeline. It keeps a table of currently executing jobs, which may be listed with the <b>jobs</b> command. When bash starts a job asynchronously (in the background), it prints a line that looks like:</p>
<pre class="tab">[1] 25647</pre>
<p class="tab">indicating that this job is job number <b>1</b> and that the process ID of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is <b>25647</b>. All of the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same job. Bash uses the job abstraction as the basis for job control.</p>
<p class="tab">To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job control, the operating system maintains the notion of a current terminal process group ID. Members of this process group (processes whose process group ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such as <b>SIGINT</b>. These processes are said to be in the foreground. Background processes are those whose process group ID differs from the terminal's; such processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals. Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or, if the user so specifies with stty tostop, write to the terminal. Background processes which attempt to read from (write to when stty tostop is in effect) the terminal are sent a <b>SIGTTIN</b> (<b>SIGTTOU</b>) signal by the kernel's terminal driver, which, unless caught, suspends the process.</p>
<p class="tab">If the operating system on which bash is running supports job control, bash contains facilities to use it. Typing the suspend character (typically <b>^Z</b>, <b>Control-Z</b>) while a process is running causes that process to be stopped and returns control to bash. Typing the delayed suspend character (typically <b>^Y</b>, <b>Control-Y</b>) causes the process to be stopped when it attempts to read input from the terminal, and control to be returned to bash. The user may then manipulate the state of this job, using the <b>bg</b> command to continue it in the background, the <b>fg</b> command to continue it in the foreground, or the <a href="/unix/ukill.htm">kill</a> command to kill it. A <b>^Z</b> takes effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing pending output and typeahead to be discarded.</p>
<p class="tab">There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell. The character <b>%</b> introduces a job specification (<b>jobspec</b>). Job number <b>n</b> may be referred to as <b>%n</b>. A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command line. For example, <b>%ce</b> refers to a stopped <b>ce</b> job. If a prefix matches more than one job, bash reports an error. Using <b>%?ce</b>, on the other hand, refers to any job containing the string <b>ce</b> in its command line. If the substring matches more than one job, bash reports an error. The symbols <b>%%</b> and <b>%+</b> refer to the shell's notion of the current job, which is the last job stopped while it was in the foreground or started in the background. The previous job may be referenced using <b>%-</b>. If there is only a single job, <b>%+</b> and <b>%-</b> can both be used to refer to that job. In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output of the <b>jobs</b> command), the current job is always flagged with a <b>+</b>, and the previous job with a <b>-</b>. A single <b>%</b> (with no accompanying job specification) also refers to the current job.</p>
<p class="tab">Naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: <b>%1</b> is a synonym for "fg %1", bringing job 1 from the background into the foreground. Similarly, "<b>%1 &amp;</b>" resumes job 1 in the background, equivalent to "<b>bg %1</b>".</p>
<p class="tab">The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state. Normally, bash waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output. If the <b>-b</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin command is enabled, bash reports such changes immediately. Any trap on <b>SIGCHLD</b> is executed for each child that exits.</p>
<p class="tab">If an attempt to exit bash is made while jobs are stopped (or, if the <b>checkjobs</b> shell option has been enabled using the <b>shopt</b> builtin, running), the shell prints a warning message, and, if the <b>checkjobs</b> option is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses. The jobs command may then be used to inspect their status. If a second attempt to exit is made without an intervening command, the shell does not print another warning, and any stopped jobs are terminated.</p>
<h2 id="prompting">Prompting</h2>
<p class="tab">When executing interactively, bash displays the primary prompt <b>PS1</b> when it is ready to read a command, and the secondary prompt <b>PS2</b> when it needs more input to complete a command. Bash allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as follows:</p>
<table class="mtable3 tab">
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>\a</b></p></td>
<td><p>an ASCII bell character (07)</p></td>

<p class="tab">The command number and the history number are usually different: the <b>history number</b> of a command is its position in the history list, which may include commands restored from the history file (see the section "<a href="#history">History</a>", below), while the <b>command number</b> is the position in the sequence of commands executed during the current shell session. After the string is decoded, it is expanded via parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal, subject to the value of the <b>promptvars</b> shell option (see the description of the <b>shopt</b> command under "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" section below).</p>
<h2 id="25A">Readline</h2>
<p class="tab">This is the library that handles reading input when using an interactive shell, unless the <b>--noediting</b> option is given at shell invocation. Line editing is also used when using the <b>-e</b> option to the <b>read</b> builtin. By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of <a href="/unix/uemacs.htm">Emacs</a>. A <a href="/unix/uvi.htm">vi</a>-style line editing interface is also available. Line editing can be enabled at any time using the <b>-o emacs</b> or <b>-o vi</b> options to the <b>set</b> builtin (see the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" below). To turn off line editing after the shell is running, use the <b>+o emacs</b> or <b>+o vi</b> options to the <b>set</b> builtin.</p>
<h2 id="25A1">Readline notation</h2>
<p class="tab">In this section, the <a href="/unix/uemacs.htm">Emacs</a>-style notation is used to denote keystrokes. Control keys are denoted by <b>C</b>-key, e.g., <b>C-n</b> means <b>Control-N</b>. Similarly, meta keys are denoted by <b>M</b>-key, so <b>M-x</b> means <b>Meta-X</b>. On keyboards without a meta key, <b>M-x</b> means <b>ESC x</b>, i.e., press the <b>Escape</b> key then the <b>x</b> key. This makes <b>ESC</b> the meta prefix. The combination <b>M-C-x</b> means <b>ESC-Control-x</b>, or press the <b>Escape</b> key then hold the <b>Control</b> key while pressing the <b>x</b> key.</p>
<p class="tab"><b>Readline</b> commands may be given numeric arguments, which normally act as a repeat count. Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the argument that is significant. Passing a negative argument to a command that acts in the forward direction (e.g., <b>kill-line</b>) causes that command to act in a backward direction. Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates from this are noted below.</p>
<p class="tab">When a command is described as killing text, the text deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (yanking). The killed text is saved in a kill ring. Consecutive kills cause the text to be accumulated into one unit, which can be yanked all at once. Commands which do not kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.</p>
<h2 id="25A2">Readline initialization</h2>
<p class="tab">Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization file (the <b>inputrc</b> file). The name of this file is taken from the value of the <b>INPUTRC</b> variable. If that variable is unset, the default is <b>~/.inputrc</b>. When a program which uses the <b>readline</b> library starts up, the initialization file is read, and the key bindings and variables are set. There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the <b>readline</b> initialization file. Blank lines are ignored. Lines beginning with a <b>#</b> are comments. Lines beginning with a <b>$</b> indicate conditional constructs. Other lines denote key bindings and variable settings.</p>
<p class="tab">The default key-bindings may be changed with an <b>inputrc</b> file. Other programs that use this library may add their own commands and bindings.</p>
<p class="tab">For example, placing</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">M-Control-u: <i>universal-argument</i></pre>
<p class="tab">or</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">C-Meta-u: <i>universal-argument</i></pre>
<p class="tab">into the <b>inputrc</b> would make <b>M-C-u</b> execute the <b>readline</b> command <i>universal-argument</i>.</p>
<p class="tab">The following symbolic character names are recognized: <b>RUBOUT, DEL, ESC, LFD, NEWLINE, RET, RETURN, SPC, SPACE,</b> and <b>TAB</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">In addition to command names, <b>readline</b> allows keys to be bound to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a <a href="/jargon/m/macro.htm">macro</a>).</p>
<h2 id="25A3">Readline key bindings</h2>
<p class="tab">The syntax for controlling key bindings in the <b>inputrc</b> file is simple. All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound. The name may be specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with <b>Meta-</b> or <b>Control-</b> prefixes, or as a key sequence.</p>
<p class="tab">When using the form <b>keyname:function-name</b> or macro, <b>keyname</b> is the name of a key spelled out in English. For example:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">Control-u: universal-argument Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word Control-o: "&gt; output"</pre>
<p class="tab">In the above example, <b>C-u</b> is bound to the function universal-argument, <b>M-DEL</b> is bound to the function <b>backward-kill-word</b>, and <b>C-o</b> is bound to run the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text "<b>&gt; output</b>" into the line).</p>
<p class="tab">In the second form, <b>"keyseq":function-name or macro</b>, <b>keyseq</b> differs from <b>keyname</b> above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence may be specified by placing the sequence within double quotes. Some <a href="/jargon/g/gnu.htm">GNU</a> Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but the symbolic character names are not recognized.</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">"\C-u": universal-argument "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"</pre>
<p class="tab">In this example, <b>C-u</b> is again bound to the function universal-argument. <b>C-x C-r</b> is bound to the function <b>re-read-init-file</b>, and <b>ESC [ 1 1 ~</b> is bound to insert the text "<b>Function Key 1</b>".</p>

<h2 id="25A5">Readline conditional constructs</h2>
<p class="tab">Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional compilation features of the C preprocessor that allows key bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result of tests. There are four parser directives used.</p>
<table class="mtable3 tab">
<tr class="tcw">
<td><p><b>$if</b></p></td>
<td><p>The <b>$if</b> construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using readline. The text of the test extends to the end of the line; no characters are required to isolate it.</p>
<p><b>mode</b></p>
<p>The <b>mode=</b> form of the <b>$if</b> directive is used to test whether readline is in <b>emacs</b> or <b>vi</b> mode. This may be used in conjunction with the set keymap command, for instance, to set bindings in the <b>emacs-standard</b> and <b>emacs-ctlx</b> keymaps only if readline is starting out in emacs mode.</p>
<p><b>term</b></p>
<p>The <b>term=</b> form may be used to include terminal-specific key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the terminal's function keys. The word on the right side of the <b>=</b> is tested against the both full name of the terminal and the portion of the terminal name before the first <b>-</b>. This allows <b>sun</b> to match both <b>sun</b> and <b>sun-cmd</b>, for instance.</p>
<p><b>application</b></p>
<p>The <b>application</b> construct is used to include application-specific settings. Each program using the readline library sets the application name, and an initialization file can test for a particular value. This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for a specific program. For instance, the following command adds a key sequence that quotes the current or previous word in bash:</p>
<pre class="tcy">$if Bash # Quote the current or previous word "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\"" $endif</pre>
</td>

<td><p>Commands in this branch of the <b>$if</b> directive are executed if the test fails.</p></td>
</tr>

<td><p><b>$include</b></p></td>

<h2 id="25A6">Searching</h2>
<p class="tab"><b>Readline</b> provides commands for searching through the command history (see section "<a href="#history">History</a>" below) for lines containing a specified string. There are two search modes: <i>incremental</i> and <i>non-incremental.</i></p>
<p class="tab"><i>Incremental searches</i> begin before the user has finished typing the search string. As each character of the search string is typed, <b>readline</b> displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed so far. An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to find the desired history entry. The characters present in the value of the isearch-terminators variable are used to terminate an incremental search. If that variable has not been assigned a value the <b>Escape</b> and <b>Control-J</b> characters will terminate an incremental search. <b>Control-G</b> will abort an incremental search and restore the original line. When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the search string becomes the current line.</p>
<p class="tab">To find other matching entries in the history list, type <b>Control-S</b> or <b>Control-R</b> as appropriate. This will search backward or forward in the history for the next entry matching the search string typed so far. Any other key sequence bound to a <b>readline</b> command will terminate the search and execute that command. For instance, a <a href="/jargon/n/newline.htm">newline</a> will terminate the search and accept the line, thereby executing the command from the history list.</p>
<p class="tab"><b>Readline</b> remembers the last incremental search string. If two <b>Control-R</b>s are typed without any intervening characters defining a new search string, any remembered search string is used.</p>
<p class="tab">Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting to search for matching history lines. The search string may be typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.</p>
<h2 id="25A7">Readline command names</h2>
<p class="tab">The following is a list of the names of the commands and the default key sequences to which they are bound. Command names without an accompanying key sequence are unbound by default. In the following descriptions, <b>point</b> refers to the current cursor position, and <b>mark</b> refers to a cursor position saved by the <b>set-mark</b> command.

<h2 id="programmable-completion">Programmable completion</h2>
<p class="tab">When word completion is attempted for an argument to a command for which a completion specification (a <b>compspec</b>) has been defined using the <b>complete</b> builtin (see the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" below), the programmable completion facilities are invoked.</p>
<p class="tab">First, the command name is identified. If the command word is the empty string (completion attempted at the beginning of an empty line), any <b>compspec</b> defined with the <b>-E</b> option to complete is used. If a <b>compspec</b> has been defined for that command, the <b>compspec</b> is used to generate the list of possible completions for the word. If the command word is a full pathname, a <b>compspec</b> for the full pathname is searched for first. If no <b>compspec</b> is found for the full pathname, an attempt is made to find a <b>compspec</b> for the portion following the final slash. If those searches do not result in a <b>compspec</b>, any <b>compspec</b> defined with the <b>-D</b> option to complete is used as the default.</p>
<p class="tab">Once a <b>compspec</b> has been found, it is used to generate the list of matching words. If a <b>compspec</b> is not found, the default bash completion as described above under Completing is performed.</p>
<p class="tab">First, the actions specified by the <b>compspec</b> are used. Only matches which are prefixed by the word being completed are returned. When the <b>-f</b> or <b>-d</b> option is used for filename or directory name completion, the shell variable <b>FIGNORE</b> is used to filter the matches.</p>
<p class="tab">Any completions specified by a pathname expansion pattern to the <b>-G</b> option are generated next. The words generated by the pattern need not match the word being completed. The <b>GLOBIGNORE</b> shell variable is not used to filter the matches, but the <b>FIGNORE</b> variable is used.</p>
<p class="tab">Next, the string specified as the argument to the <b>-W</b> option is considered. The string is first split using the characters in the <b>IFS</b> special variable as delimiters. Shell quoting is honored. Each word is then expanded using brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, as described above under the section "<a href="#expansion">Expansion</a>." The results are split using the rules described above under the section "<a href="#word-splitting">Word Splitting</a>." The results of the expansion are prefix-matched against the word being completed, and the matching words become the possible completions.</p>
<p class="tab">After these matches have been generated, any shell function or command specified with the <b>-F</b> and <b>-C</b> options is invoked. When the command or function is invoked, the <b>COMP_LINE</b>, <b>COMP_POINT</b>, <b>COMP_KEY</b>, and <b>COMP_TYPE</b> variables are assigned values as described above under the section "<a href="#shell-variables">Shell Variables</a>." If a shell function is being invoked, the <b>COMP_WORDS</b> and <b>COMP_CWORD</b> variables are also set. When the function or command is invoked, the first argument is the name of the command whose arguments are being completed, the second argument is the word being completed, and the third argument is the word preceding the word being completed on the current command line. No filtering of the generated completions against the word being completed is performed; the function or command has complete freedom in generating the matches.</p>
<p class="tab">Any function specified with <b>-F</b> is invoked first. The function may use any of the shell facilities, including the <b>compgen</b> builtin described below, to generate the matches. It must put the possible completions in the <b>COMPREPLY</b> array variable.</p>
<p class="tab">Next, any command specified with the <b>-C</b> option is invoked in an environment equivalent to command substitution. It should print a list of completions, one per line, to the standard output. Backslash may be used to escape a newline, if necessary.</p>
<p class="tab">After all of the possible completions are generated, any filter specified with the <b>-X</b> option is applied to the list. The filter is a pattern as used for pathname expansion; a &amp; in the pattern is replaced with the text of the word being completed. A literal <b>&amp;</b> may be escaped with a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match. Any completion that matches the pattern will be removed from the list. A leading <b>!</b> negates the pattern; in this case any completion not matching the pattern will be removed.</p>
<p class="tab">Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the <b>-P</b> and <b>-S</b> options are added to each member of the completion list, and the result is returned to the readline completion code as the list of possible completions.</p>
<p class="tab">If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and the <b>-o dirnames</b> option was supplied to complete when the <b>compspec</b> was defined, directory name completion is attempted.</p>
<p class="tab">If the <b>-o plusdirs</b> option was supplied to complete when the <b>compspec</b> was defined, directory name completion is attempted and any matches are added to the results of the other actions.</p>
<p class="tab">By default, if a <b>compspec</b> is found, whatever it generates is returned to the completion code as the full set of possible completions. The default bash completions are not attempted, and the readline default of filename completion is disabled. If the <b>-o</b> <b>bashdefault</b> option was supplied to complete when the <b>compspec</b> was defined, the bash default completions are attempted if the <b>compspec</b> generates no matches. If the <b>-o</b> default option was supplied to complete when the <b>compspec</b> was defined, readline's default completion will be performed if the <b>compspec</b> (and, if attempted, the default bash completions) generate no matches.</p>
<p class="tab">When a <b>compspec</b> indicates that directory name completion is desired, the programmable completion functions force readline to append a slash to completed names which are symbolic links to directories, subject to the value of the mark-directories readline variable, regardless of the setting of the <b>mark-symlinked-directories</b> readline variable.</p>
<p class="tab">There is some support for dynamically modifying completions. This is most useful when used in combination with a default completion specified with <b>complete -D</b>. It's possible for shell functions executed as completion handlers to indicate that completion should be retried by returning an exit status of 124. If a shell function returns 124, and changes the <b>compspec</b> associated with the command on which completion is being attempted (supplied as the first argument when the function is executed), programmable completion restarts from the beginning, with an attempt to find a new <b>compspec</b> for that command. This allows a set of completions to be built dynamically as completion is attempted, rather than being loaded all at once.</p>
<p class="tab">For instance, assuming that there is a library of <b>compspecs</b>, each kept in a file corresponding to the name of the command, the following default completion function would load completions dynamically:</p>
<pre class="tab tcy">_completion_loader()
{
     . "/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; return 124
}
complete -D -F _completion_loader</pre>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p class="tab">When the <b>-o</b> history option to the <b>set</b> builtin is enabled, the shell provides access to the command history, the list of commands previously typed. The value of the <b>HISTSIZE</b> variable is used as the number of commands to save in a history list. The text of the last <b>HISTSIZE</b> commands (default 500) is saved. The shell stores each command in the history list prior to parameter and variable expansion (see the section "<a href="#expansion">Expansion</a>" above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the values of the shell variables <b>HISTIGNORE</b> and <b>HISTCONTROL</b>.</p>
<p class="tab">On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the variable <b>HISTFILE</b> (default <b>~/.bash_history</b>). The file named by the value of <b>HISTFILE</b> is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than the number of lines specified by the value of <b>HISTFILESIZE</b>. When the history file is read, lines beginning with the history comment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the preceding history line. These timestamps are optionally displayed depending on the value of the <b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b> variable. When an interactive shell exits, the last <b>$HISTSIZE</b> lines are copied from the history list to <b>$HISTFILE</b>. If the <b>histappend</b> shell option is enabled (see the description of <b>shopt</b> under the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" below), the lines are appended to the history file, otherwise the history file is overwritten. If <b>HISTFILE</b> is unset, or if the history file is unwritable, the history is not saved. If the <b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b> variable is set, time stamps are written to the history file, marked with the history comment character, so they may be preserved across shell sessions. This uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines. After saving the history, the history file is truncated to contain no more than <b>HISTFILESIZE</b> lines. If <b>HISTFILESIZE</b> is not set, no truncation is performed.</p>
<p class="tab">The builtin command <b>fc</b> (see the "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" section below) may be used to list or edit and re-execute a portion of the history list. The <b>history</b> builtin may be used to display or modify the history list and manipulate the history file. When using command-line editing, search commands are available in each editing mode that provide access to the history list.</p>
<p class="tab">The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the history list. The <b>HISTCONTROL</b> and <b>HISTIGNORE</b> variables may be set to cause the shell to save only a subset of the commands entered. The <b>cmdhist</b> shell option, if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a multi-line command in the same history entry, adding semicolons where necessary to preserve syntactic correctness. The <b>lithist</b> shell option causes the shell to save the command with embedded newlines instead of semicolons. See the description of the <b>shopt</b> builtin below under the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" for information on <b>set</b>ting and <b>unset</b>ting shell options.</p>
<h2 id="history-expansion">History expansion</h2>
<p class="tab">The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the history expansion in <b>csh</b>. This section describes what syntax features are available. This feature is enabled by default for interactive shells, and can be disabled using the <b>+H</b> option to the <b>set</b> builtin command (see the section "<a href="#28A">Shell Builtin Commands</a>" below). Non-interactive shells do not perform history expansion by default.</p>
<p class="tab">History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous commands quickly.</p>
<p class="tab">History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is read, before the shell breaks it into words. It takes place in two parts. The first is to determine which line from the history list to use during substitution. The second is to select portions of that line for inclusion into the current one. The line selected from the history is the event, and the portions of that line that are acted upon are words. Various modifiers are available to manipulate the selected words. The line is broken into words in the same fashion as when reading input, so that several metacharacter-separated words surrounded by quotes are considered one word. History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history expansion character, which is <b>!</b> by default. Only backslash (<b>\</b>) and single quotes can quote the history expansion character.</p>
<p class="tab">Several characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately following the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted: <b>space</b>, <b>tab</b>, <b>newline</b>, <b>carriage return</b>, and <b>=</b>. If the <b>extglob</b> shell option is enabled, <b>(</b> will also inhibit expansion.</p>
<p class="tab">Several shell options settable with the <b>shopt</b> builtin may be used to tailor the behavior of history expansion. If the <b>histverify</b> shell option is enabled (see the description of the <b>shopt</b> builtin below), and readline is being used, history substitutions are not immediately passed to the shell parser. Instead, the expanded line is reloaded into the readline editing buffer for further modification. If readline is being used, and the <b>histreedit</b> shell option is enabled, a failed history substitution will be reloaded into the readline editing buffer for correction. The <b>-p</b> option to the history builtin command may be used to see what a history expansion will do before using it. The <b>-s</b> option to the history builtin may be used to add commands to the end of the history list without actually executing them, so that they are available for subsequent recall.</p>
<p class="tab">The shell allows control of the various characters used by the history expansion mechanism (see the description of <b>histchars</b> above under the section "<a href="#shell-variables">Shell Variables</a>"). The shell uses the history comment character to mark history timestamps when writing the history file.</p>
<h2 id="event-designators">Event designators</h2>

Each time it is invoked, <b>getopts</b> places the next option in the shell variable name, initializing name if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the variable <b>OPTIND</b>. <b>OPTIND</b> is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked. When an option requires an argument, <b>getopts</b> places that argument into the variable <b>OPTARG</b>. The shell does not reset <b>OPTIND</b> automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple calls to <b>getopts</b> within the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.

If there are fewer words read from the input stream than names, the remaining names are assigned empty values. The characters in IFS are used to split the line into words. The backslash character (<b>\</b>) may be used to remove any special meaning for the next character read and for line continuation. Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:</p>

<p><b>-N</b> <i>nchars</i>: read returns after reading exactly <i>nchars</i> characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input, unless EOF is encountered or read times out. Delimiter characters encountered in the input are not treated specially and do not cause read to return until <i>nchars</i> characters are read.</p>
<p><b>-p</b> <i>prompt</i>: Display prompt on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read any input. The prompt is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.</p>
<p><b>-r</b>: Backslash does not act as an escape character. The backslash is considered to be part of the line. In particular, a backslash-newline pair may not be used as a line continuation.</p>
<p><b>-s</b>: Silent mode. If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.</p>

<p><b>-P</b>: If set, the shell does not follow symbolic links when executing commands such as <b>cd</b> that change the current working directory. It uses the physical directory structure instead. By default, bash follows the logical chain of directories when performing commands which change the current directory.</p>
<p><b>-T</b> If set, any traps on DEBUG and RETURN are inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment. The DEBUG and RETURN traps are normally not inherited in such cases.</p>

This option is only used by interactive shells.</p>
<p><b>checkhash</b>: If set, bash checks that a command found in the hash table exists before trying to execute it. If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal path search is performed.</p>
<p><b>checkjobs</b>: If set, bash lists the status of any stopped and running jobs before exiting an interactive shell. If any jobs are running, this causes the exit to be deferred until a second exit is attempted without an intervening command (see the section "<a href="#job-control">Job Control</a>").

<p><b>histverify</b>: If set, and readline is being used, the results of history substitution are not immediately passed to the shell parser. Instead, the resulting line is loaded into the readline editing buffer, allowing further modification.</p>
<p><b>hostcomplete</b>: If set, and readline is being used, bash will attempt to perform hostname completion when a word containing a <b>@</b> is being completed (see "<a href="#completion">Completing</a>" under "<a href="#25A">Readline</a>," above). This is enabled by default.</p>
<p><b>huponexit</b>: If set, bash will send <b>SIGHUP</b> to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.</p>

<p><b>lastpipe</b>: If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last command of a pipeline not executed in the background in the current shell environment.</p>
<p><b>lithist</b>: If set, and the <b>cmdhist</b> option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to the history with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon separators where possible.</p>
<p><b>login_shell</b>: The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell (see "<a href="#invocation">Invocation</a>" above). The value may not be changed.</p>
<p><b>mailwarn</b>: If set, and a file that bash is checking for mail has been accessed since the last time it was checked, the message "The mail in mailfile has been read" is displayed.</p>
<p><b>no_empty_cmd_completion</b>: If set, and readline is being used, bash will not attempt to search the <b>PATH</b> for possible completions when completion is attempted on an empty line.</p>
<p><b>nocaseglob</b>: If set, bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing pathname expansion (see "<a href="#pathname-expansion">Pathname Expansion</a>" above).</p>
<p><b>nocasematch</b>: If set, bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when performing matching while executing <b>case</b> or <b>[[</b> conditional commands.</p>
<p><b>nullglob</b>: If set, bash allows patterns which match no files (see "<a href="#pathname-expansion">Pathname Expansion</a>" above) to expand to a null string, rather than themselves.</p>
<p><b>progcomp</b>: If set, the programmable completion facilities (see "<a href="#programmable-completion">Programmable Completion</a>" above) are enabled. This option is enabled by default.</p>
<p><b>promptvars</b>: If set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal after being expanded as described in "<a href="#prompting">Prompting</a>" above. This option is enabled by default.</p>
<p><b>restricted_shell</b>: The shell sets this option if it is started in restricted mode (see "<a href="#restricted-shell">Restricted Shell</a>" below). The value may not be changed. This is not reset when the startup files are executed, allowing the startup files to discover whether or not a shell is restricted.</p>
<p><b>shift_verbose</b>: If set, the <b>shift</b> builtin prints an error message when the shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters.</p>

<p><b>3 arguments</b>: The following conditions are applied in the order listed. If the second argument is one of the binary conditional operators listed above under <a href="#conditional-expressions">Conditional Expressions</a>, the result of the expression is the result of the binary test using the first and third arguments as operands. The <b>-a</b> and <b>-o</b> operators are considered binary operators when there are three arguments.

<td><p>The command <i>arg</i> is to be read and executed when the shell receives signal(s) <i>sigspec</i>. If <i>arg</i> is absent (and there is a single <i>sigspec</i>) or <b>-</b>, each specified signal is reset to its original disposition (the value it had upon entrance to the shell). If <i>arg</i> is the null string the signal specified by each <i>sigspec</i> is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes. If <i>arg</i> is not present and <b>-p</b> has been supplied, then the trap commands associated with each <i>sigspec</i> are displayed. If no arguments are supplied or if only <b>-p</b> is given, trap prints the list of commands associated with each signal. The <b>-l</b> option causes the shell to print a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers. Each <i>sigspec</i> is either a signal name defined in <b>&lt;signal.h&gt;</b>, or a signal number. Signal names are case insensitive and the <b>SIG</b> prefix is optional.</p>
<p>If a <i>sigspec</i> is EXIT (0) the command <i>arg</i> is executed on exit from the shell. If a <i>sigspec</i> is DEBUG, the command <i>arg</i> is executed before every simple command, for command, case command, select command, every arithmetic for command, and before the first command executes in a shell function (see "<a href="#shell-grammar">Shell Grammar</a>," above). Refer to the description of the <b>extdebug</b> option to the <b>shopt</b> builtin for details of its effect on the DEBUG trap. If a <i>sigspec</i> is RETURN, the command <i>arg</i> is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the . or source builtins finishes executing.</p>
<p>If a <i>sigspec</i> is ERR, the command <i>arg</i> is executed whenever a simple command has a non-zero exit status, subject to the following conditions. The ERR trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test in an if statement, part of a command executed in a <b>&amp;&amp;</b> or <b>||</b> list, or if the command's return value is being inverted via <b>!</b>. These are the same conditions obeyed by the errexit option.</p>
<p>Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset. Trapped signals that are not being ignored are reset to their original values in a subshell or subshell environment when one is created. The return status is false if any <i>sigspec</i> is invalid; otherwise trap returns true.</p>
