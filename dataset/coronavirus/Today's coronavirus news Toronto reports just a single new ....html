The person declined to be identified because the results had not been publicly released.</p><p class="text-block-container">Nine players on the 30-man roster, two taxi squad players and two staff members tested positive earlier, stranding the team in Philadelphia and prompting the postponement of four MLB games.</p><p class="text-block-container">The Marlins underwent another round of tests Tuesday morning.

The weakness came from a drop in the expectations index, which measures consumer views about the short-term outlook for income, business and labour market conditions.</p><p class="text-block-container">The consumer confidence index is closely watched for signals it can send about future consumer spending, which accounts for 70 per cent of economic activity.</p><p class="text-block-container"><strong>9:55 a.m.</strong><em> </em>North American stock markets dipped in early morning trading while gold settled down after setting another record high.</p><p class="text-block-container">The S&amp;P/TSX composite index was down 53.09 points at 16,108.24.</p><p class="text-block-container">In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 108.20 points at 26,476.57.

Africa&#8217;s top oil producer was also reeling from a collapse in crude prices earlier in the year and is suffering from rampant dollar shortages. Combined they have exacerbated the strain on a wide range of businesses in a country that has long struggled to provide jobs for its young population.</p><p class="text-block-container">The data from Jobberman, which recruits mainly white-collar employees and doesn&#8217;t track those looking for non-skilled, blue-collar work, chimes with official estimates that sees unemployment in the nation of more than 200 million soaring to 34 per cent by the end of the year from 23 per cent in 2019.</p><p class="text-block-container"><strong>8:32 a.m. </strong>A week after appearing to project a more serious tone about the coronavirus, President Donald Trump is back to pushing unproven claims that an anti-malaria drug is an effective treatment and challenging the credibility of the nation&#8217;s leading infectious disease expert.</p><p class="text-block-container">Dr. Anthony Fauci pushed back Tuesday, saying he will keep doing his job.</p><p class="text-block-container">Numerous studies, meanwhile, have shown that the drug, hydroxychloroquine, is not an effective treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently withdrew an order that allowed the drug&#8217;s use as a emergency treatment for COVID-19.</p><p class="text-block-container">Yet overnight, after returning from a trip to North Carolina where he promoted efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, Trump retweeted a series of tweets advocating for hydroxychloroquine.</p><p class="text-block-container">The president also shared a post from the Twitter account for a podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, a former top White House adviser to Trump, accusing Fauci of misleading the public over hydroxychloroquine.</p><p class="text-block-container">Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, pushed back Tuesday during an appearance on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Good Morning America.&#8221;</p><p class="text-block-container">&#8220;I go along with the FDA,&#8221; said Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. &#8220;The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.&#8221;</p><p class="text-block-container"><strong>8:31 a.m. </strong>Real Madrid forward Mariano has tested positive for the coronavirus, the club said Tuesday.</p><p class="text-block-container">The announcement came as the team returned to practice ahead of its Champions League match against Manchester City on Aug. 7.
