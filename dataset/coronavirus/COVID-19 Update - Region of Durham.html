 <h4>Mandatory face coverings will continue in all indoor, enclosed public spaces in Durham Region during Stage 3 of the provincial government’s Framework for Reopening...</h4> 
 <blockquote class="IntroParagraph">
  A message from your Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Robert Kyle
 </blockquote> 
 <p>Today, I issued <a href="#ClassOrders">updated instructions</a> to expand the use of mandatory face coverings to all indoor, enclosed public spaces throughout Durham Region. These instructions are an extension of the directions provided on July 6 and are issued to help with efforts to decrease the spread of COVID-19 in the community. Although many members of our community are currently wearing face coverings as outlined in my instructions from July 6, there continues to be a risk for increased cases of COVID-19 in the community during Stage 3. Mandatory face coverings in indoor, enclosed public spaces during Stage 3 will help us to continue to reduce the risk of increased spread of illness and aligns with other regions and municipalities, and other public health units. Indoor, enclosed public spaces include any spaces open to the public where the public interact with each other and with staff of these establishments. These spaces include places where goods and services are sold, municipal facilities, including libraries, indoor attractions, event spaces, indoor entertainment facilities, athletic facilities, dining establishments, and private transportation services. Some establishments have separate guidelines and regulations and are not included in these instructions, such as schools, childcare centres, day camps, places of worship, hospitals, offices not open to members of the public, and outdoor spaces. The Health Department will focus enforcement activities on educating community members about the mandatory requirements for non-medical masks or face coverings. Business operators should make every effort to remind customers to wear a face covering, but also be mindful that some in our community may be unable to wear a face covering for very valid reasons. I ask all area residents and business operators to be respectful, work together and recognize that some people may be exempt from wearing a face covering for various reasons including health concerns, age or religious reasons. Business operators should not deny access to goods or services if a face covering cannot be worn, and no person is required to provide proof of exemption. Please remember to continue to practise physical distancing wherever possible even when wearing a face covering, and refer to Health Department resources on <a title="Open new window to view how to keep safe while using your non-medical face mask or face covering" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/en/health-and-wellness/resources/Documents/Novel-Coronavirus/COVID-Keep-Safe-Using-Face-Mask.pdf" target="_blank">how to keep safe while using your non-medical face mask or face covering</a>, <a title="Open new window to view choosing a proper non-medical face mask or face covering" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/en/health-and-wellness/resources/Documents/Novel-Coronavirus/COVID-Tips-For-Choosing-Face-Mask.pdf" target="_blank">choosing a proper non-medical face mask or face covering</a>, and <a title="Open new window to view how to make a no sew mask" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/en/health-and-wellness/resources/Documents/Novel-Coronavirus/COVID-19-How-To-Make-A-Mask-June-20.pdf" target="_blank">how to make a no sew mask</a>.</p>

The province’s decision was made in consultation with Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health and was based on results of key public health indicators. In Stage 3, almost all businesses and public spaces can reopen with public health measures in place to protect staff and the public. Certain high-risk places and activities may not open during Stage 3 due to the likelihood of large crowds congregating, difficulties with physical distancing, or challenges maintaining the proper cleaning and sanitation required to prevent the spread of COVID-19. A complete list of places that can and cannot open in Stage 3 is available in&nbsp;<a title="Open new window to view A Framework for Reopening our Province: Stage 3" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/framework-reopening-our-province-stage-3" target="_blank">A Framework for Reopening our Province: Stage 3</a>.

Public health measures that residents can take to protect themselves and others (e.g. proper hand hygiene, staying home if feeling unwell, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces often, avoid touching one’s face, etc.) have not changed and are recommended to reduce the spread of germs. Please refer to Health Department resources on&nbsp;<a title="Open to view durham.ca/novelcoronavirus" href="/en/health-and-wellness/novel-coronavirus-update.aspx">durham.ca/novelcoronavirus</a>&nbsp;for actions you can continue to take to reduce the spread of COVID-19. With everyone’s commitment and cooperation, we have seen progress across Durham Region and a decrease in the number of new cases of COVID-19. In Stage 3, we will need the continued commitment of all area residents to maintain these gains and prevent an increase in the spread of illness.&nbsp;</p>

     </blockquote> <p>Currently, Durham Region is in Stage 2 of the government’s reopening framework and we may receive communication about movement to Stage 3 in the coming weeks. During Stage 2, we have seen many local businesses and workplaces reopen including restaurant patios, recreational water facilities, some personal service settings, malls and other area services. As the Region continues to reopen, we must all remember that the risk for the ongoing spread of illness remains. Area residents are asked to continue following public health advice to prevent a potential increase in COVID-19 spread in our community. The Health Department’s COVID-19 web page provides numerous resources that can help residents understand the status of COVID-19 activity in our Region, and the preventative measures that they can take to keep themselves and others safe. Residents can find: information about COVID-19 testing and accessing test results; up to date information on COVID-19 cases in Durham Region through the Durham Region COVID-19 Data Tracker; a comprehensive Community Reopening Toolkit that includes guidance to residents and businesses to prepare for the safe reopening of our community; Section 22 class orders and special instructions that I have issued; information about non-medical masks and face coverings, and resources to help residents choose, make and use non-medical masks; up to date information about travel; and, additional facts about COVID-19. Through the various stages of reopening, please continue to stay informed, practise physical distancing, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, and wear a non-medical mask or face covering in commercial establishments.

     </blockquote> <p>During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Durham Region Health Department had to close clinics and suspend many regular programs and services to ensure our capacity to respond to COVID-19, comply with provincial direction and ensure public safety. Now that the number of new cases of COVID-19 has been decreasing across the Region, the Health Department can begin to restore priority programs and services with protective measures in place to ensure the safety of clients and staff. The Health Department is pleased to advise residents that we are gradually restoring our clinical services. Clinical programs began to see clients on July 6 and we will slowly be increasing availability and the range of services throughout the summer. Services are now being provided at the Breastfeeding, Oral Health and Sexual Health clinics. Residents can call Durham Health Connection Line at 1-800-841-2729 to make an appointment. Currently, all clinic visits are by appointment only and walk-in patients will not be accepted at any location to help control the spread of COVID-19. Clients will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms, assessed regarding their appointment needs, and will be required to wear a non-medical mask or face covering to all in-person clinic appointments. Our Infant and Child Development program will be providing virtual care to clients and the Immunization program will provide appointments for priority clients. The Health Department is also working hard to ensure delivery of priority health protection programs. West Nile virus surveillance activities began at the beginning of June and&nbsp;<a title="Open new window to view weekly adult mosquito surveillance results" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/en/health-and-wellness/resources/Documents/IllnessInfectionDisease/AdultMosquitoSurveillance.pdf" target="_blank">weekly adult mosquito surveillance results</a>&nbsp;are provided on durham.ca. Public health inspectors have also been investigating all animal bites and scratches to prevent the spread of rabies to residents. The Health Department has completed 670 rabies investigations, so far this year. Public health inspections are also still focused on ensuring that required preventative measures to safeguard against COVID-19 have been implemented. As the Health Department begins to restore its programs and services, COVID-19 will continue to be a public health priority. We will continue to review new information, assess the risks to the public and will adjust our restoration plans as required.</p>

On June 24, I issued a&nbsp;<a title="Open new window to view the class order" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/en/health-and-wellness/resources/Documents/Novel-Coronavirus/COVID-19-Class-Order-Section-22-June24.pdf" target="_blank">class order</a>, under the authority of the&nbsp;<em>Health Protection and Promotion Act</em>, that will strengthen our ability to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of our essential food sector workers. The class order is a legal tool to help ensure that agricultural farm owners/operators and staff comply with the directions set out in the order. Farm owners/operators who employ TFWs are required to implement public health measures and take actions listed in the order to minimize the risks to health for those they employ. In addition to the class order, Region of Durham Paramedic Services has been working hard to collect swabs for testing from TFWs to support our surveillance testing efforts. The surveillance testing will help to proactively prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the temporary foreign worker and agricultural worker populations.

Thank you to all area residents and community partners that have been working hard to follow public health advice to help keep community members healthy and safe. Everyone’s cooperative efforts have helped us to move past the peak of COVID-19 infection in Durham Region. Now that we are beginning to see a decrease in the number of new cases reported in our Region, we can broaden the number of individuals with whom we maintain close contact. The provincial government is encouraging people throughout Ontario to establish a social circle of no more than 10 people who can interact and come into close contact with one another without physical distancing. This means that residents may be able to hug, touch and be close with family and friends outside their immediate household, which will support the mental health and well-being of all residents.</p> 
     <hr> <h5>To create a social circle:</h5> 
     <ol> 
      <li>Start with the people you live with or who regularly come into your household;</li> 
      <li>If there are less than 10 people that you currently live with or come into your home regularly, you may add family members, friends or other households to your circle;</li> 
      <li>All members of a social circle should agree that they will be part of your social circle and no other social circle;</li> 
      <li>To ensure safety of your social circle, practise physical distancing with any individual outside of your circle; and,</li>

     </blockquote> <p>As the provincial government gradually begins to ease restrictions, Durham Region residents will need to continue to be vigilant and take protective public health measures to prevent themselves and others from becoming ill. To continue to closely monitor the spread of COVID-19, the provincial government released an expanded testing plan which includes: asymptomatic, risk-based testing; targeted testing for vulnerable populations; and, ongoing testing to respond to and manage outbreaks. Testing and contact tracing help us to understand transmission, identify trends and monitor the spread of COVID-19. Residents who are symptomatic (people with at least one symptom of COVID-19, even mild and atypical symptoms), residents who are asymptomatic (people with no symptoms but who are concerned that they have been exposed to COVID-19) and individuals who are at risk of exposure in their workplace, can get tested. Testing for COVID-19 is through an upper respiratory tract specimen (nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab and/or viral throat swab) to test for the presence of the virus. Residents who would like to be tested for COVID-19 must complete the&nbsp;<a title="Open new window to view the Lakeridge Health online assessment form" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=U_dz6nZpnkGVKtP9eq4LpL7ZTFjtC9RLh1gs7qUPyRxUMFpaTjVQM0JBNkdHTzE0UFFVUkxZUFNORS4u" target="_blank">Lakeridge Health online assessment form</a>. Once the form is submitted, the Assessment Centre will respond and provide further instructions. The Assessment Centre does not accept walk-in clients. It is always important to remember that a test will only provide a point-in-time result. Residents exposed to COVID-19 following a negative test may develop symptoms and may need to be tested again. If you have been tested and you develop symptoms at a later time, you must immediately self-isolate to prevent others from becoming ill. All residents, even those with negative test results, must continue to practise physical distancing, wash their hands often and take additional public health precautions, such as using a face covering (non-medical mask) when physical distancing may not be possible, to keep themselves, their families, colleagues and community members healthy and safe.</p>

We know that older adults are at greater risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and physical distancing may be challenging for those living in group settings and using shared spaces. The Health Department is working hard to minimize the risks of COVID-19 by taking extra steps to facilitate testing, on a volunteer basis, for residents and staff of these homes. The purpose of surveillance testing is to learn more about the spread of COVID-19, especially asymptomatic infection, in the community. This information provides a point-in-time picture of COVID-19 and can help inform timely strategies to prevent the spread of illness. With the help of Region of Durham Paramedic Services, and the support of our local partners including group homes, retirement homes, shelters and our Social Services colleagues, 3,140 swabs for testing have been collected from residents and staff, as of June 8. In addition, thanks to the collaborative efforts of our administrative services staff, paramedics, public health inspectors and public health nurses who are working hard to organize and monitor testing, we have successfully completed surveillance activities at over 50 facilities. We hope that the enhanced surveillance testing will help to protect vulnerable populations in our community.</p>

Thank you to everyone who is doing their part and only going out when necessary. You are helping us to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in Durham Region. At the same time, residents should also pay attention to their health and any symptoms that require urgent attention. Residents should always call 911 if they are in medical distress and need urgent care. Emergency departments, paramedics and 911 services are continuing to respond to medical emergencies. The Region of Durham Paramedic Services has implemented numerous measures to ensure the safety of patients who require transport to hospital, as well as the paramedics providing care. Local hospitals have also taken precautions and implemented changes to ensure the safety of patients such as frequent cleaning, staff wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), frequent hand-washing, separate care areas for patients with COVID-19 and screening at emergency room entrances. Some of the signs that may indicate a medical emergency include: unconsciousness, lack of breathing, or lack of pulse; chest pain or discomfort; severe pain; shortness of breath or dizziness; choking; broken bones; severe bleeding; trouble seeing or speaking; sudden, severe headaches; and sudden weakness, numbness, or tingling in the face, arms or legs. If you are in medical distress and need urgent care and have symptoms of COVID-19, call 911 and let the operator know that you may have COVID-19. This will ensure that paramedics arriving on scene can take appropriate precautions.

     </blockquote> <p>This week, May 24-30, is National Paramedic Services Week and I acknowledge the hard work, support and selfless dedication of the paramedics in the Region of Durham Paramedic Services (RDPS). The theme for this year is Pandemic: Paramedics on the Front Line – a truly appropriate message as it demonstrates the important role that paramedics play as part of the first response team of the healthcare system during a pandemic. RDPS is made up of more than 330 advanced care and primary care paramedics serving the residents of Durham Region and surrounding area, responding to over 145,000 calls for service every year. The members of this highly skilled team are often the first on the scene providing care and support in very challenging conditions, and COVID-19 has dramatically affected the way paramedics keep themselves and the public safe and healthy. Throughout this pandemic, RDPS has played an integral role in providing assistance and working with Health Department staff to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. In addition to responding to ongoing emergency requests for service throughout our community, RDPS provided invaluable support to the Health Department’s COVID-19 response by collecting over 1,060 nasal swabs for testing from long-term care residents and staff, as part of the provincial surveillance initiative to get a point-in-time picture of COVID-19 in these facilities. COVID-19 has also created added strain on paramedic services, as paramedics need to be careful not to expose themselves to the virus and risk spreading it to others in the community. This means wearing numerous kinds of personal protective equipment (PPE) several times per shift, which is necessary to protect both paramedics and members of our community. In addition, the diligent work of the logistics and operational support staff, who work behind the scenes everyday, is imperative to ensure our paramedics are able to provide the best service to the residents of Durham Region. As key members of first responders, all members of RDPS play a vital role in the response to COVID-19 and I thank them all for their ongoing commitment to our community during these challenging times.</p>

     </blockquote> <p>On May 13, the case definition for COVID-19 was updated to include multisystem inflammatory vasculitis as an atypical presentation in children. This inflammatory illness has recently been reported in a small number of children worldwide in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the symptoms associated with this illness include persistent fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), as well as rash. This multisystem inflammatory vasculitis has symptoms that may also occur in Kawasaki disease (an illness that causes inflammation of the arteries). Parents should contact their health care providers if their children experience these symptoms. Residents may have also heard of COVID toes in the media, which refers to skin findings observed in some individuals with COVID-19, characterized by swollen, painful and/or itchy lesions on the feet, toes and fingers. At this time, the Ontario Ministry of Health guidance has not identified COVID toes as an atypical symptom in children. If you have concerns about your child’s health, contact your health care provider. Please continue to follow public health advice to protect yourself and your children from COVID-19. Continue to practice physical distancing, wash your hands often with soap and water, avoid touching your face and keep surfaces clean and disinfected. If you experience symptoms, please stay home and if your symptoms worsen, seek clinical assessment by either completing an online self-assessment, or contacting Durham Health Connection Line, Telehealth Ontario or your health care provider.

CLOCA has many beautiful conservation areas throughout Durham Region to enjoy, and it is very important for our health and well-being to remain active, get outdoors and appreciate nature. While this is good news for area residents, the risk of COVID-19 spread remains in the community. We ask that visitors follow physical distancing guidelines and use personal protective measures to protect themselves and others from becoming ill. We remind all visitors to: not gather in groups and avoid crowded places; limit close contact with individuals outside your household, both in indoor and outdoor spaces; stay at least two metres (six feet) away from other people; greet others from a distance with a wave or a nod; pay attention to physical barriers in place to ensure physical distancing; avoid touching your face; keep hand sanitizer with you so you can clean your hands often; cover your sneeze with a tissue and immediately throw the tissue in the garbage, practice hand hygiene and if you do not have a tissue, sneeze into your sleeve or arm; use contactless payment systems and avoid handling money as much as possible; and wash your hands with soap and water at the first opportunity. Please remember to stay home if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or you have been in close contact with anyone who has been sick with the virus. As the government continues to ease restrictions, residents should stay informed by visiting&nbsp;<a title="View our COVID-19 Update page" href="/en/health-and-wellness/novel-coronavirus-update.aspx">durham.ca/novelcoronavirus</a>, often and referring to the most current and credible public health information and recommendations available from the <a title="Open new window to view Province of Ontario" href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus" target="_blank">Province of Ontario</a>, <a title="Open new window to view Public Health Ontario" href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/" target="_blank">Public Health Ontario</a>, <a title="Open new window to view Government of Canada" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html" target="_blank">Government of Canada</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Open new window to view World Health Organization" href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>.</p>

Please visit the&nbsp;<a title="Open new window to view Province of Ontario" href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/" target="_blank">Province of Ontario</a>&nbsp;for the most up to date information. While this is good news for both residents and business owners, it is critical that we all continue to maintain physical distancing, wash our hands frequently, clean high-touch surfaces often, and follow instructions when accessing services. As businesses begin to re-open, residents will see many changes in the way that services are provided, such as minimized use of cash transactions, needing to make appointments for service or pick-up, and being asked to remain in one’s car for curbside pick-up transactions. Since there is still a risk of COVID-19 spread in the community, these changes are crucial to maintain the health and safety of employees and clients. The Health Department is committed to supporting local businesses by providing advice on measures they can implement to operate in a safe way. If we all work together and support each other during this transition period, then we will all be able to get back to our normal routines and the activities we enjoy sooner.

As the need for resources to address COVID-19 grew, our nurses across all programs immediately responded. They changed their schedules, shifted gears, received training and jumped in to provide support to residents and local partners. The Health Department has a team of highly skilled nurses who have been working with their colleagues to keep residents and local stakeholders informed, support residents who are ill and protect those at risk of becoming ill. Over the past three months, our nurses have completed more than 48,000 phone interactions with residents and community partners, managed more than 1,100 COVID-19 cases, followed almost 2,200 contacts of confirmed cases of COVID-19, and completed more than 14,000 nursing assessments to determine if further medical intervention is required. Our nurses are excellent listeners and skilled problem-solvers who work to understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by area residents. Our nurses also work collaboratively with colleagues across the Health Department to ensure a coordinated response utilizing the experience, expertise and skills of our diverse staff. As key members of the Health Department team, our nurses have played a vital role in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we will continue to rely on them to help us through this challenging time.</p>

In addition to measures already implemented to help reduce the risks for long-term care residents and staff, the Health Department and local partners have mobilized resources to conduct surveillance testing for all staff and residents in long-term care homes, and staff in emergency child care centres by May 15, in accordance with provincial direction. The enhanced surveillance testing will help to further understand the spread of COVID-19 in long-term care homes and will help to proactively prevent the spread of COVID-19 in local emergency child care centres. This significant undertaking involves a collaborative approach which can only be achieved with the efforts and support of our local partners including long-term care homes, child care centres, Lakeridge Health, and our Social Services colleagues. I am thankful for an excellent team of administrative services staff, public health inspectors and public health nurses who are working tirelessly to organize and monitor testing at these facilities, and I am grateful for the highly skilled paramedics that are supporting COVID-19 response activities and conducting testing where needed. Thanks to the support of our local partners and coordinated efforts of everyone, we anticipate that our surveillance activities will be completed within the provincial timeline and we hope that the enhanced surveillance testing will help to protect vulnerable populations in our community.</p>

Staff was monitoring the global situation very closely in order to prepare for the potential emergence of COVID-19 in Durham Region. As COVID-19 began to spread rapidly across the globe, the Health Department mobilized its resources and began implementing measures identified in the Health Department Emergency Master Plan. Some of the Health Department’s pandemic response activities include: assessment and surveillance; case management and contact tracing; communication; development and implementation of new policies and procedures; documentation and reporting; facilitating testing; and, response to inquiries. Throughout the pandemic, we have ensured ongoing collaboration with local community partners. We are thankful for the support from our community partners who have helped us to coordinate activities and resources to keep residents safe and informed. Using the latest evidence and recommendations received from provincial partners, our staff has developed communications, guidance documents and resources for local stakeholders and the public. Resources are continually updated as we learn more about COVID-19. Our public health nurses continue to work closely with residents who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 to help identify potential risk for their family members, friends or other community members who may have had contact with these individuals. By assessing the risk of exposure to others, contacting community members that may have been exposed, and providing instructions and information about next steps and self-isolation, our staff work to minimize the further spread of COVID-19 in the community. The COVID-19 situation is continually evolving and new information is being shared by the provincial and federal governments daily. At this time, the risk to the community from COVID-19 is ongoing; we will continue to engage with local and provincial partners to monitor this risk and implement provincial recommendations and directives.

     </blockquote> <p>Over the past few weeks the Health Department has received many good questions about how COVID-19 is transmitted and the risks to the public in community settings, such as grocery stores. Scientists continue to study this virus and its characteristics, and are learning more every day. Public health professionals use the latest scientific evidence to provide the best advice possible to politicians, decision-makers and the public. Current evidence shows that the most common person-to person transmission of COVID-19 occurs via infectious respiratory droplets, which are produced when someone coughs, sneezes or speaks. The respiratory droplets are heavy and fall to surfaces quickly. The virus enters a person’s body by respiratory droplets containing the virus that adhere to mucous membranes of a person’s eyes, nose or mouth. An uninfected person can come into contact with these respiratory droplets either through close contact with someone who is infected, or by touching a surface or an object contaminated with the virus and then proceeding to touch one’s eyes, nose or mouth. The amount of time that the virus survives on surfaces varies depending on the surface itself and environmental conditions; the current range is between hours to days. This is why it is very important that we all continue to practice physical distancing by keeping at least two metres (six feet) away from others, wash our hands often and clean areas that are touched frequently (such as doorknobs). Please be aware that wearing gloves or non-medical masks alone will not protect you if you do not practice proper hand hygiene and proceed to touch your eyes, nose or mouth. If residents choose to wear gloves at a grocery store, touch an infected surface and then proceed to rub their eyes with their glove, there is a serious risk of infection. In health care settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed on an infected person, such as intubation, the procedures can generate airborne-spread which can scatter the virus further in the air and can be inhaled. Medical professionals must wear appropriate personal protective equipment when performing medical procedures and coming in contact with patients.

Drinking alcohol and consuming cannabis have many immediate and long-term health risks. Immediate effects of alcohol can include loss of judgement, falls and injuries, and alcohol poisoning. Long-term risks include cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke; drinking as little as one drink a day increases a person’s risk for seven different types of cancer. Health risks associated with regular or heavy cannabis use include problems with thinking, memory or co-ordination, impairment leading to injuries, hallucinations, mental health problems, and breathing or lung problems associated with smoking.

     </blockquote> <p>We know that COVID-19 is spreading throughout our community and residents with no travel history or known direct contact with positive cases are getting ill. We are continuously assessing our actions and monitoring cases to identify where we can do more. I have now taken more progressive action to protect the health of Durham Region residents. Using my legal authority under the Health Protection and Promotion Act, I have issued an order that requires anyone that has tested positive for COVID-19, or anyone who has had contact with someone who has COVID-19, to self-isolate for 14 days or longer, if directed by public health staff. Those that do not follow this order can face a fine of up to $5,000 a day. For more information and certain exceptions, please visit&nbsp;<a title="View our COVID-19 Update page" href="/en/health-and-wellness/novel-coronavirus-update.aspx">durham.ca/novelcoronavirus</a>.

     </blockquote> <p>It’s spring time and we’re finally starting to see milder temperatures. Understandably, everyone wants to spend time outside; but during these unprecedented times, we all must remember to keep our distance when going outside. On March 30, the Government of Ontario extended the Declaration of Emergency and issued a new emergency order to close all outdoor recreational amenities such as playgrounds and sports fields. Social gatherings of more than five people are also prohibited at this time. To protect yourselves and the health of our children, please respect the provincial orders and do not use play structures, basketball courts or any outdoor recreational amenities. When going outside for a walk, keep at least two metres (6 feet) away from others and remind your children to do the same. We all need to do our part to #FlattenTheCurve and help stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community.</p>

Our new dashboard, the Durham Region COVID-19 Data Tracker, shows the number of COVID-19 cases in Durham Region by status (home isolation, hospitalized, resolved, deceased), municipality, age and gender. This resource also displays the number of new cases and cumulative cases by reported date and onset date, and is a very useful tool to keep up-to-date on the Health Department’s COVID-19 response. This information will help us to see if our actions such as social/physical distancing and self-isolation are helping to "flatten the curve", or if we need to do more. The information on the dashboard will be updated daily.

     </blockquote> <p>Please protect yourself and others by self-isolating if you have been instructed to do so. Self-isolating will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to your loved ones and within our community. Anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough, sore throat or difficulty breathing), is returning from travel, or has been given instructions to self-isolate by their health care provider, public health, or their workplace must self-isolate for at least 14 days. It is also recommended that anyone over 70-years old and individuals who are immunocompromised should self-isolate to protect themselves. Self-isolating means staying home and avoiding all contact with others. This means not even leaving your home to get essentials from the pharmacy or your local grocery store. If you find yourself in this situation, reach out to a family member, neighbour or friend to pick up a few essential items or ask your local pharmacy about delivery options for necessary prescription medication. Remember to keep at least two metres (six feet) away from individuals who are delivering essentials to you.

We also provide advice to Region of Durham and local area municipalities based on evidence, federal/provincial guidelines and local data, so that municipal/community leaders can make the important decisions that will help protect the health and well-being of our community. The situation not only changes daily, but often hourly.
