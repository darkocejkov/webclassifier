			 From   to  , these are the titles we've already dedicated hours to playing this year. Last year may not have gone down  , but hey, at least we got  . The 2010s, however, represented a step forward for the industry, with titles like   and the   series. Now, we’re midway into the first year of a new decade, and in a twilight year too. The console market is quickly shifting. Soon the   and   will be booted to the trash heap, and we’ll wish them farewell while welcoming in a super-powered generation of machines. The   is bringing heavy-duty tech that rivals the guts of even the strongest PC towers, and the   seems just as formidable. But fret not, the old consoles are going out with a bang in terms of new games. This year has been stacked with titles spanning all audiences, from plenty of action RPGs and first-person shooters, to some insanely narrative-driven games, to some equally artful and wacky indie projects. A new   (!!) and a sequel to  have proven that you can always rely on impressive triple-A outtings. Same goes for the always-innovative indie community, with a gem like  blessing our consoles. The previous-gen consoles' goodbye tour may be bittersweet, but with boundary-pushing titles like  and  , it has already been a great year. These are the 15 best video games that have been released in 2020 so far. (But if you’re still unhappy with this gaming slate, don't forget that we’ll still be blessed by the divine god   in due time.) 
 June 19  PS4  You have to give Naughty Dog credit: Its team had a nearly impossible chance of following up  , which was one of the most beloved games of the last decade. Not to mention, a beginning-to-end journey that was so satisfying that its fans were all but sure a sequel would ruin everything. Turns out, all those delays were well worth it:   is, at the very least, on par with the legend it followed, continuing Ellie’s story with the kind of unforgettable heart and heartbreak that we rarely see in video games.  April 10  PS4  This year we finally got to return to Midgar, and it was glorious. Sure, any game surrounded by this much hype was bound to have criticism heaped on it, but the remake is a masterful re-imagining of the title that redefined what an RPG could be.   introduced an engaging style of action RPG, both melding the party balancing system from traditional RPGs with more fluid, flashy combat, and overturning the turned-based system. By no means does the  remake replace the original. It instead does something even better: It creates what feels like a truly new experience.   March 20  Nintendo Switch  What’s left to say about  ? By now, you’ve likely settled into your forever life with your critter villagers, all of whom you’ve surely spent months cycling in and out so you could share an island with your favorites. So, grab an orange juice, sit next to Henry the frog by the lake you just cleared, and relax. Nice. Best game? Yeah, best game.    July 17  PS4  Easily a contender for my Game of the Year (at least until   comes out in a few weeks),   wasn't on my radar nearly as enough as it should have been before its launch (my bad), and now it's all I can play. It is a blend of stunning and non-exhausting open-world adventuring, intensely thoughtful combat, gorgeous landscapes, and in-depth story, peppered with homages to classic samurai cinema. The game is a perfect send-off for the PS4, really showing what this generation ultimately became by taking the tech to its absolute limit.   April 30  PS4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch This is how a legend returns in style.   is an honor to the classic beat ‘em up, and a brilliant expansion on a semi-forgotten genre. So far I’ve played it through about five times, and it's still not getting old. The combat is stylish and addictive, and the art style is drop dead gorgeous—everything a Sega fanboy could hope for. We’ve seen a lot of older titles get rebooted, especially by the killer indie studio DotEmu (which did  ,  , and more).  is a great game that continues in the spirit of the originals, setting a precedent for more forgotten retro titles to be revived in the future.   April 28  PS4, Xbox One, PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch  Team 17’s at it again with frantic, rage-inducing couch co-op. The folks who brought us  made the move into the home market with a game that is all about working with a team to pivot, angle, and position furniture. It is a blast. The concept may be simple, but rest assured it will have you feeling all sorts of fury at the execution. Couch co-op itself is often a forgotten form in gaming, but a personal favorite of mine. Nothing like having a few drinks and trying to coordinate with some friends.  March 5  PC, Nintendo Switch If you haven’t heard of  , the best way I can put it is this:  but better. It’s a perfectly handled detective flick with linear problem-solving and logic puzzles. It’s also a great change of pace that’s easily accessible for anyone who loves a good puzzle, a fun story, and well-written dialog.   stands apart as an immensely inventive and creative game in an industry that tends to favors doing, not thinking.  March 20  PS4, Xbox One, PC, Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch  Speaking of “doing, not thinking,”   is on the flip side.   hack, slash, chainsaw, and glory kill demons on your way through literal hell. This game is fast-paced, flashy, and everything that made those narc moms on ‘90s TV say, “Video games will rot your brain.” And it's amazing for it.   feels like what we hope a modern  would be, but so polished. It's amazing how far  as a series has been pushed since 1993. Folks, there's not a lot more to say here besides: Killing demons has never felt so damn good.  February 14  PS4 Ah,  . Why did you do it? If you haven’t heard,   gives its players nearly unprecedented tools to create  , which other users can try out once they’re finished. Yeah. So queue up  and you’ll find… “Wario Goes to McDonald’s.” Not your jam? There’s “Wario Gets Run Over By a Car.” In all fairness, we have seen some truly incredible games in  (check out  ). But really, most people are there for the memes. Aren’t we all?  March 11  Xbox One, PC  is one of the few 2020 Xbox exclusives out there, and it almost makes up for the lack of others. The  series kicked off back in 2015 with  , which in its own right was a beautiful platform adventure that yanked on your heartstrings through simplistic storytelling and world building. For , take everything  had going for it and multiply it by ten. It is a mesmerizing experience, featuring one of the best art styles and soundtracks of any game on this list.   March 23 PC A survival game? Not for the faint of heart. A survival game in virtual reality? Shit.  , which is set between  and  , is really a see-it-to-believe-it thing. But trust us, it’s the closest experience to our inevitable  , all-VR-everything lives we’ve ever had. So, go ahead: Chuck a grenade, watch it go boom, and try to avoid the nightmare monsters hurtling toward your face.   January 28 PS4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch Take   remove the controversy, add a layer of consistently hilarious dialogue, and you get  . It’s a game about exploration, which sounds like an early 2011 tagline, but in this case it's actually successful. I found myself playing co-op with my friends for hours. The game is for a pretty specific type of gamer, but that's okay. If you're looking for a title that's not going to force objectives down your throat and instead really let you do it your way, it's  . If you're just keen on having a good time, look up some of its cutscenes and dialogue, because those alone are more than worth it.  July 17 Nintendo Switch I’m a sucker for  . People actually have started calling me Paper Cam, probably because I carry a giant hammer around, am paper thin, and always move in the style of turn-based combat.   is a wonderfully inventive return to the   style we all love. After a series of missteps (looking at you,  ), the new mechanics and simplified tone feel like an homage to the flat glory days of the N64 and GameCube era. This game is comfort food through and through, and that's something we all could use right now.   June 5  Nintendo Switch -freaking- . It’s got everything: chess, blackjack, president, poker, checkers, Connect 4, mancala—a full collection of, you guessed it, 51 games. After getting absolutely thrashed by my editor in mancala, I had picked up   to play, learn, and plan for my next strike. Honestly, it is just really well-polished and an all-around good time, especially if you want something a little slower and more accessible. My pandemic goal is to become a full master of all 51 games, and even the bonus piano.  July 23  Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch Big alien monster. Gore. Space. 16 bit. Metroidvania. If that's not enough to get you up and buying this game immediately, then I don't know how to help you.  has players take control of a menacing space creature in a 16-bit space station, getting them to cleverly strike against the colony inhabitants, and bringing a whole new playstyle and moveset to an otherwise tired gaming genre. The title just came out, but for a $20 price tag it's an easy pick-up-and-go option. Stay scared and  my friends.  2018 was a record-breaking year for our industry, with total video game sales exceeding $43.4 billion. Over 164 million adults in the United States play video games and three-quarters of all Americans have at least one gamer in their household. As the leading form of entertainment today, video games are an integral part of American culture. It’s now more important than ever to understand who America’s video game players really are and what’s driving them. That’s why the Entertainment Software Association is thrilled to share the 2019 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry. For the first time, we at the ESA have taken a comprehensive look at the individual Americans who enjoy video games in order to better understand their profiles and interests. The resulting data speaks for itself. Video game players represent a diverse cross-section of the American population spanning every age, gender, and ethnicity. Contrary to common misconception, they’re also generally healthy, civically engaged, college-educated, and socially active. More than three-quarters of gamers surveyed report that video games provide them with mental stimulation (79%) as well as relaxation and stress relief (78%). The role of video games in the American family is also changing: nearly three-quarters (74%) of parents believe video games can be educational for their children, and more than half (57%) enjoy playing games with their child at least weekly. The 2019 Essential Facts simply illustrates what we in the industry already know to be true: we are living in the golden age of video games, and video game players are thriving.

 Karaoke complexes might be relatively common now, but back in 2004 singing into a PlayStation was the closest most of us could get.   formed the caterwauling soundtrack to millions of student gatherings, hen parties and five-pint Fridays all over Europe for more than a decade. Like Just Dance, it harnesses the infectious joy of pop music in a way that anyone can play. A gleeful absurdist masterpiece in which you start by rolling up pencils and apple peel and end up absorbing buildings, trees and, eventually, most of the planet in your big sticky ball, because why not? From the infectious soundtrack to the endearingly mad “plot”, it’s a work of pure joy.  is a short and moving shared experience whose music, evocative colour palette and simple play come together as they only can in games, for a powerful emotional effect. It’s often picked as an ur-example of games as art – including by curators at the V&A, where it was front and centre  . Resident Evil meets Alien seems like such an obvious game pitch that it is incredible it wasn’t realised until 2008. In  , the player becomes lowly engineer Isaac Clarke, who finds himself investigating the “planet-cracking” ship Ishimura after radio contact with the vessel is lost. The craft is, of course, infested with alien creatures – the Necromorphs – who utilise the reanimated corpses of human victims in horrible ways. This is a dark, bloody and atmospheric survival-horror thrill ride. The central character here is a boy on the run from death, or perhaps already dead. One of several games that kicked off the indie-game renaissance of the 2010s,  ’s monochrome style and relatively short running time belie the extraordinary effort and fastidiousness that went into its creation, evident in everything from the sinister movements of a giant spider to the precise physics that power its puzzles. You are a border officer in a war-torn country where people are constantly trying to smuggle things past you: drugs, weapons, falsified IDs. But what about the mother and young child using a fake passport to rejoin the rest of their family? Or an undocumented refugee who you could reject as a possible terrorist, but who may in fact be a desperate civilian?   is a powerful illustration of how we can become complicit in inhumane systems, and the ways games can invite us to explore complex ethical dilemmas. Combining an open-world structure with the energy of a music festival,   made arcade-style racing games fun again. Boasting a gigantic selection of cars and an inventive AI-assisted multiplayer component, the game was designed around simply letting the player have fun, no matter what they did or where they drove. Barn finds and destructible signs rewarded exploration, while a multitude of driving challenges provided structure and challenge. It’s an accessible, multifaceted racing treat. “Football, but with remote control cars” is a likely pitch for  , but who expected it would become one of the most skilful and enduring multiplayer games released in decades? Rocket League is elegant and ageless: it will probably still be played in 20 years, in living rooms and in tournaments. Guildford-based developer Criterion built its   of arcade driving games around two principles: speed and style. Taking place through traffic-packed city streets, the races rewarded players for risky manoeuvres, providing extra time to shoot past competitors. The third title in the series perfected the recipe, adding a “takedown” feature that encouraged players to smash rivals from the circuit. The detailed slow-motion physics engine heightened every smash into art. After years of gritty, military shooters filled with macho spec-ops nobodies,   stormed on to the online gaming scene in 2016 like a giant kawaii robot bunny wielding a hot pink grenade launcher. This is a game about outlandish hero characters, joining forces in condensed team-based skirmishes. There is no levelling up, there are no weapons unlocks; it’s all about combining the different capabilities – from Mei’s endothermic blaster to Mercy’s healing staff – in effective ways. Loved for its brash, hyper-colourful aesthetic, Overwatch is the generation Z answer to Counter-Strike. Imagine a science-fiction war film directed by an early-career Kathryn Bigelow. Now imagine it’s interactive. This, in essence, is Gears of War, the definitive third-person space marine blast-’em-up – a game so macho, its machine guns have chainsaws. The second title in the series improved the cover system, added new weapons and bloody finishing moves and took the battle to the Locust alien invaders. It was thrilling, chaotic and beautiful and, with the brilliant co-op Horde gameplay mode, it invented new ways to play online. Fondly remembered by anyone who had a   in their dorm room, this is still probably the best skateboarding game around, and there hasn’t been much competition since (perhaps due to the sport’s waning cultural presence since the 1990s). It is a time capsule of energetic college rock, endless point-chasing skate combos and irresistibly fun play. The 2018 game Ultimate is, well, the ultimate expression of  ’ maximalist tendencies, with 74 characters and hundreds of references to Nintendo history. But Melee is the game that turned Nintendo’s anything-goes brawler from a living-room classic into a competitive fixture. It is still the most popular Smash game at tournaments, beautifully balanced and extraordinarily fun. Konami’s answer to Resident Evil ditched zombie shocks for psychological horror. The second title   is the most disturbing. The game follows grief-stricken everyman James Sunderland as he arrives in the eponymous town searching for his supposedly dead wife. What follows is a descent into Sunderland’s psychosexual dysfunction, a viscera-splattered nightmare of undead nurses, animated shop window dummies and the giant fetishistic monster, Pyramid Head. Toying with Japanese horror and exploitation cinema, it cast a sombre spell over all who played. Derek Yu’s   is fun to play on every single run, yet might take years to actually finish. Each time a different arrangement of cave creatures, unfortunate accidents and hostile geography conspires to bring your adventure to an abrupt close, and only the extremely skilled and extremely lucky will ever get right down into the depths. Even after years of play, Spelunky holds its mystique. The original Assassin’s Creed promised a rich historical adventure with an interesting sci-fi overlay –   actually delivered it. Set in a luxuriously detailed approximation of Renaissance Italy, the game sees attractive assassin, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, taking on the dastardly templars while bumping into the likes of Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci. The freeform structure of the game, its mass of side quests and objectives, along with its range of abilities and items set the blueprints for modern open-world game design. With a script by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini and all the key voice talent from the brilliant animated series,   exudes authenticity from every pixel. This is the Batman of Frank Miller and Christopher Nolan – dark, twisted and violent – and it’s perfectly realised as a third-person action adventure. The combat is smooth and empowering, the silent takedowns are gratifying and the asylum setting is a superb gothic monstrosity. A comic-book lover’s dream. With the first title in the   series, developer Digital Illusions brought large-scale cooperative combat and historical authenticity to the online shooter genre. Two teams of 32 players fought for dominance of vast environments, taking control points and commandeering vehicles. The multifaceted battles required players to assume complementary roles, some sniping from a distance, others running in as infantry. The excitement of a well-organised attack paying off felt like something truly new. Bringing cinematic verve and explosive pace to the military shooter market, 2003’s Call of Duty provided gunfights of epic intensity. But it wasn’t until   that the series made a major impact, introducing an innovative multiplayer online mode that offered character progression alongside unlockable single-use mega-attacks. Add in its blistering animation and intense, claustrophobic maps, and it’s little wonder this game defined the online deathmatch experience for a decade.  still sets the bar for its genre of expansive, visually spectacular interactive storytelling. Guiding a reformed violent god and his more sensitive son through settings from Norse mythology, you’ll see things that take the breath away: the corpse of an immense giant, frozen where he fell; parallel realms of vicious elves and shining, endless lakes; crumbling relics to absent gods. The pleasing   of Kratos’ axe as it hits the skulls of mythological monsters punctuates video games’ grandest odyssey. In this  , a young man sets out to topple mountainous, mournful and majestic giants in the hope of reviving a lost love. Each colossus is a puzzle; clambering up their mossy fur and plunging a sword into their hides, we soon learn that this hero’s quest isn’t what it seems. Subtle and profound, Shadow of the Colossus is disciplined in its storytelling and artistic direction, with ample space for reflection in its bleak and beautiful wilderness. Combining first-person shooter and action role-playing with real-world conspiracy theories and cyberpunk mythology, Ion Storm’s agenda-setting sci-fi adventure was a cultural event. The player character, JC Denton, is a “nano-augmented” government agent caught in a labyrinthine, globe-stomping plot about bioengineered viruses and alien technology. There are dozens of routes through the story, providing incredible freedom and inspiring a creative community of modders and fan-fiction writers. Few games have been played as widely as Wii Sports, from grannies bowling to toddlers enthusiastically playing tennis. Wii Sports was the world’s introduction to the   and a whole generation’s introduction to Nintendo’s philosophy of game design: accessible, inclusive and great fun. What warm-blooded person has never dreamed of busting out an impeccable guitar solo on stage, revelling in the adoration of a baying crowd? Anyone born after about 1995, it turns out. But Guitar Hero was a product of its time and catered so brilliantly to the near-ubiquitous rock star fantasy, with its impeccable soundtrack of 1970s, 80s and 90s power rock, that tens of millions of people were wielding plastic guitars in living rooms within a couple of years. A co-op online zombie shooter with an AI system that orchestrated enemy attacks based on player actions,   was ridiculously ahead of its time. Valve built excellent mechanics around its collaborative gameplay, encouraging highly tactical teamwork, and loaded its apocalyptic world with brilliant monsters, such as the grotesque tongue-lashing Smoker and the terrifyingly lachrymose witch. It would do amazing business in the multiplayer-obsessed, YouTuber-streaming world of modern gaming. Experimental designer Fumito Ueda built this quiet, thoughtful adventure around the idea of two people holding hands, which is what the eponymous lead character and jailed princess Yorda must do if they are to escape their castle prison. Using all the conventions of a third-person action game, Ico is really about fear, solitude and the possibilities awakened by making physical contact with another human being. A minimalist masterpiece. What looks at first like a standard entry in gaming’s extensive zombie-apocalypse canon soon turns out to be something more. Watching the relationship between grieving, grizzled Joel and guarded but optimistic teenager Ellie develop as they travel a ravaged America, creeping past unsettling “clickers” and coming face-to-face with desperate, violent fellow humans makes for an extraordinarily memorable game in an often boring genre. Possibly Nintendo’s most unsettling game,   is also one of its most creative, trapping you in an apocalyptic time loop where the leering moon draws ever closer to the hapless Earth and its denizens cower in fear. Here, Link is a hero that nobody knows about, having gone forward in time to thwart an evil that was due to swallow up the world, before being returned to his childhood body and deserted by his only companions. Its time-loop structure and eerie atmosphere remain little-imitated. We have yet to encounter a person who doesn’t enjoy Mario Kart, and   is as good as it gets: gleeful, freewheeling, with a marvellously jazzy score, colourful characters and courses that continually defy expectations. It is riotously enjoyable. One of the few modern games that is still best enjoyed shoulder-to-shoulder with friends, family or friendly strangers. The defining chapter of BioWare’s space epic tackles everything: race, genocide, romance and heroism, all against a backdrop of impending galactic doom. It is brilliantly performed and exciting to play, with futuristic guns and biotic powers, and totally engrossing on a character level. Creating something of this scope that also feels personal to each player is no small feat. Launched as a forgettable co-op zombie shooter in 2017, developer Epic Games saw the success of Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds and decided to create its own   mode, inviting 100 players to land on an island, then fight it out until only one survived. Colourful, silly and filled with daft outfits and infectious dance moves, Fortnite became  , attracting more than 250m players. It’s been featured in everything from Fox News to Avengers: Endgame and shows few signs of slowing down.  comes to New York looking to escape the life of crime he had been leading in eastern Europe – but as in all Grand Theft Auto games, the American dream swiftly turns sour, and nihilistic violence turns out to be the only currency Bellic can deal in. GTA IV’s New York is stunning to inhabit, so detailed and full of life that it is hard to believe it’s powered by code. Only a developer with Rockstar’s extremely deep pockets and fanatical attention to detail could have made something like this, a re-creation of turn-of-the-20th-century US so lifelike that it is  . Its story, of a dwindling gang of outlaws trying to outrun the march of time (and an ever-growing list of enemies) is impressive enough, but the world in which it takes place – vast, picturesque, full of people and strange encounters that most players will probably never even find – is a true monument to interactive achievement. One of the most successful and influential games ever made, The Sims is an outlet for megalomania, mad materialism or compassion – depending on the player. Controlling the lives of computer people, from their loves and careers to designing the homes they live in, is so compelling that it raises troubling questions about human nature. Indiana Jones-style hero Nathan Drake came into his own in this spectacular cinematic adventure sequel. Crammed with breathtaking action set pieces, exotic locations and exciting lore, Among Thieves established the Uncharted series at the forefront of big-budget narrative game design. From the wrecked train opening to the epic finale amid the ruins of the mythical kingdom of Shambhala, the pace doesn’t let up. While baby boomers have nostalgic memories of Saturday-morning action cinema, millennials have Uncharted. This wasn’t just an exciting horror story about a supercop rescuing the US president’s daughter from a Spanish cult. With Resident Evil 4, the creator of Capcom’s survival horror series, Shinji Mikami, completely changed the structure and style of the games, abandoning the slow-burn tension of the original titles in favour of raw action while (crucially) shifting from an expressionistic third-person camera to an over-the-shoulder perspective. The game established a whole new era of third-person shooters. After his galactic adventures in the   Galaxy games, Odyssey brought the cheerful plumber back down to Earth. Well, not Earth per se, but a bunch of different self-contained planets that provide ample room for Nintendo designers’ wild imaginations. From possessing a Chain Chomp to bounding around in low gravity, chasing rabbits or racing yetis, Odyssey is irresistibly exuberant. Launched in 2004, Blizzard’s massively multiplayer role-playing adventure was not the first entry in this complex genre (Ultima Online and Everquest got there earlier), but it perfected the key elements, from combat mechanics to quest design to background lore, building an obsessive fanbase that has stayed loyal through multiple add-ons and updates. The game reached 100m player accounts in 2014, but the real stories have been much more personal – with its emphasis on close team-play, WoW has hosted real-life weddings   funerals, becoming as much a part of players’ lives as their own families. Bloated, idiosyncratic and troubling in places, The Phantom Pain is the perfect culmination of Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear vision as it has evolved over the last 30 years. Big Boss wakes up from a coma and finds himself carrying out covert missions during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, rescuing civilians, kidnapping military leaders and managing his aquatic Mother Base as the typically nonsensical plot rolls on. It is unlike anything else out there … at least until Hideo Kojima’s forthcoming game   turns up. For decades, games have aspired to create a fantasy world that caters to your every whim – and Skyrim comes closest. Dragon-flavoured, largely unmemorable plot notwithstanding, it is an extraordinary playground where magic, might, words and weapons can all be wielded against the inhabitants and monsters that populate a snow-touched northern realm, and where subplots about assassins, vampires, lost relics and a thousand other things await the curious player. An extraordinary work of horror,   conjures a dilapidated city whose inhabitants, rather than abandoning God, have become so obsessed with getting closer to their eldritch masters that they’ve become diseased. Hunting the creatures of Yharnam, an exhilarating and sometimes painfully challenging endeavour, the player uncovers an extraordinarily intricate, disturbing fiction of blood, beats and human folly. There are sights and fights in Bloodborne that no player could ever forget. Set in a doomed undersea utopia, BioShock is part shooter, part role-playing game, part morality fable, propelling players through a haunting and ambiguous quest to escape Rapture while learning its awful secrets. Famed for the hulking Big Daddy antagonists, the genetic modifications, the art deco architecture and designer  ’s exploration of objectivist philosophy, the game has been one of the most discussed and dissected of the century so far. Building on the solid foundations of its predecessor, Valve’s 2011 sequel adds a more involved narrative to the ingenious physics puzzles, with tyrannical computer system GLaDOS providing an endlessly funny and inventive exploration of humanity and hubris. Here, the Aperture Lab is a giant, almost gothic, ludological construction, its weird research rooms and robotic production lines crammed with light bridges and lasers. It is the combination of Red Dwarf, 2001 and Crystal Maze no one knew they were waiting for. One of the first shooters where the aliens fought back. Playing Halo today, especially on the Legendary difficulty setting, it is amazing how quickly those chattering, cackling Covenant can flush you out.   has spawned a beloved universe of space-opera shooters, but it’s the first game – released at a time when the idea of a first-person shooter on a console was laughable – that made the biggest impact. In this, the  , Rockstar painstakingly created a bizarre pastiche of southern California, seen through the eyes of three decidedly unheroic protagonists: a retired gangster whose family hates him, a young man from the inner city trying to escape a seemingly pre-destined life of crime, and a violent trailer-dwelling psychopath. Cleverly, these three characters also handily partition GTA’s split personality: biting satire of modern US, filmic storytelling, and directionless violent mayhem. Many games offer the superficial choice between good and evil, but the Witcher asks what happens when you’re adrift on waves of history and politics that are beyond your control. Geralt of Rivia isn’t a hero; he’s just an outcast, present at a tumultuous time in his realm’s history. Turns out that far more interesting stories can be found when you’re not preoccupied with a facile objective to save the world. Video games aren’t short of alien invasion stories but Half-Life 2 is so good it makes the whole concept seem fresh and frightening. Taking place several years after the original, Gordon Freeman wakes to find an Earth utterly subjugated by the Combine forces – but a resistance movement is forming. The shrewd environmental puzzles and the famed   exploit the intricate physics engine to make this hellish world feel authentic. You truly hate the enemies, you live every moment. One of the greatest narrative video games ever made. You are dead, which comes with few advantages, but at least you can’t die again – not for good, anyway. Plunging you into a never-ending cycle of death and rebirth in a world where almost nothing still breathes, Dark Souls sets you off with nothing and lets its horror-tinged dark fantasy unfold as you flail and struggle to survive. Invigoratingly uncompromising and influential, it was the breakthrough game of FromSoftware and visionary director Hidetaka Miyazaki. Despite two   and a raft of imitators, there is still nothing like it. Doing for the open-world game what Half-Life 2 did for the first-person shooter, Breath of the Wild tears up and throws away all the things that make exploration a chore – checklists, objective markers, forests of icons – to make way for true adventure. Breath of the Wild counts on your curiosity, intelligence, self-determination and ingenuity, giving you a thousand ways to apply them. Its thrillingly open wilderness makes other games feel like a quaint miniature train ride by comparison. Swedish coder Markus “Notch” Persson didn’t invent the concept of the block-based building game – Minecraft arrived just after Zach Barth’s experimental title Infiniminer. However, the founder of Stockholm studio   took the idea of a Lego-like construction game based in a procedurally generated environment and perfected it. Originally launched as a work in progress in the summer of 2009, word about this unusual blocky simulation quickly spread on PC gaming forums and a community of enthusiastic modders started to gather around the project, downloading Persson’s version but adding their own rules and graphics. From the very beginning Minecraft was a shared endeavour – a labour of love, shared between creator and fans. By the time of its full release in November 2011,   already had 10 million registered players. Later came conversions from PC to Xbox, PlayStation and smartphones, bringing in new audiences. The game was split into two experiences: the Survival mode where players had to battle zombies and giant spiders while mining for resources, and the Creative mode where they were given an unlimited inventory of wooden, glass and stone blocks to concentrate on crafting their own ambitious projects. This has always been the vital element of Minecraft’s success and importance: it is a dozen experiences in one. It’s about making models, but also exploration, combat and resource management. Participants can build alone or join friends, introducing a new form of online creative collaboration. Using the game’s red stone component, which allows objects in the world to be electrically powered, fans began to build complex machines including working calculators. Others constructed scale models of the USS Enterprise, Hogwarts and King’s Landing. Art galleries and museums began to take notice. The Tate Modern commissioned expert modellers to create versions of modernist artworks in the Minecraft world; the British Museum was officially recreated in the game, as was Great Ormond Street Hospital. Over the past decade, Minecraft has become a hobby and a social space. Servers have been set up for people on the autistic spectrum, providing a vital means of meeting with and communicating with others.   of Minecraft to teach physics, geology, drama, art, electronics and sustainable farming. The cultural and educational reach of the game is enormous. Minecraft was vital in the rise of the celebrity   – with names like StampyCat and DanTDM familiar to millions. With more than 175m copies now sold on an array of devices from smartphones to virtual-reality headsets, Minecraft has transcended the idea of what games are and what they can achieve. When you load the game, what you do is up to you – it gives you the experience you want, and that is different for everyone. There has never been an interactive entertainment experience like it. Game makers truly believe that video games have the power – just like literature, cinema and art – to change lives. This one unquestionably, demonstrably has. Time and time again. A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation.

 There are dozens of ways you could put together a list of the best video games ever made. You could look to classics, like "Super Mario Bros." You could look at impact on the medium, or highest sales. You could write down your personal favorites on pieces of paper, then throw them into the air. Where the pieces land? That's your list!

 A   is an   that involves interaction with a   to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional     such as a  ,   or  / . Since the 1980s, video games have become an increasingly important part of the  , and whether   is a matter of dispute.
 The electronic systems used to play video games are called  . Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others. Specialized platforms such as  , which present the game in a large, typically   chassis, were common in the 1980s in  , but declined in popularity as other, more affordable platforms became available. These include dedicated devices such as  , as well as general-purpose computers like a  ,   or  .
 The   used for games, the  , varies across platforms. Common controllers include  ,  ,  ,  , the   of  , or even a person's body, using a   sensor. Players view the game on a   such as a   or   or sometimes on     goggles. There are often game  , music and voice actor lines which come from   or  . Some games in the 2000s include  , vibration-creating effects,     and   headsets.
 Since the 2010s, the commercial importance of the   has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and   on   in particular are driving the growth of the industry. As of 2018, video games generated sales of US$134.9 billion annually worldwide,  and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.
 Early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats. The earliest example is from 1947—a "  Amusement Device" was filed for a patent on 25 January 1947, by   and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on 14 December 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992.  Inspired by   display technology, it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen.  Other early examples include:  's   game, the   computer at the 1951  ;   a   Computer game by   for the   in 1952;  , an electronic interactive game engineered by   in 1958;  , written by   students Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's on a DEC   computer in 1961; and the hit  -style  , a 1972 game by  . Each game used different means of display: NIMROD used a panel of lights to play the game of  ,  OXO used a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe    used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court,  and   used the   PDP-1's vector display to have two   battle each other. 
 In 1971,  , created by   and  , was the first commercially sold, coin-operated video game. It used a black-and-white television for its display, and the computer system was made of      .  The game was featured in the 1973    .   was followed in 1972 by the  , the first home console. Modeled after a late 1960s prototype console developed by   called the "Brown Box", it also used a standard television.  These were followed by two versions of  's  ; an   version in 1972 and a home version in 1975 that dramatically increased video game popularity.  The commercial success of   led numerous other companies to develop   clones and their own systems, spawning the  . 
 A flood of   clones eventually led to the  , which came to an end with the mainstream success of  's 1978    ,  marking the beginning of the   and inspiring dozens of manufacturers to enter the market.  The game inspired arcade machines to become prevalent in mainstream locations such as shopping malls, traditional storefronts, restaurants, and convenience stores.  The game also became the subject of numerous articles and stories on television and in newspapers and magazines, establishing   as a rapidly growing mainstream hobby.    was soon licensed for the   (later known as Atari 2600), becoming the first " " and quadrupling the console's sales.  This helped Atari recover from their earlier losses,  and in turn the Atari VCS revived the home video game market during the  , up until the  .  The home video game industry was revitalized shortly afterwards by the widespread success of the  ,  which marked a shift in the dominance of the video game industry from the United States to Japan during the  . 
 A number of video game developers emerged in Britain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
 The term "platform" refers to the specific combination of   or computer hardware which, in conjunction with software, allows a video game to operate.  The term "system" is also commonly used. The distinctions below are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms. In addition to  /  and  , there are other devices which have the ability to play games but are not primarily video game machines, such as   and  .
 In common use a " " refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with a personal computer connected to a  .  Personal computers are not dedicated game platforms, so there may be differences running the same game on different hardware. Also, the openness allows some features to developers like reduced software cost,  increased flexibility, increased innovation, emulation, creation of modifications (" "), open hosting for   (in which a person plays a video game with people who are in a different household) and others. A   is a PC or laptop intended specifically for gaming.
 A " " is played on a specialized electronic device (" ") that connects to a common   or  , unlike  , which can run all sorts of computer programs, a console is a dedicated video game platform manufactured by a specific company. Usually consoles only run games developed for it, or games from other platform made by the same company, but never games developed by its direct competitor, even if the same game is available on different platforms. It often comes with a specific  . Major console platforms include  ,  , and  .
 A " " gaming device is a small, self-contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. It features the console, a small screen, speakers and buttons,   or other   in a single unit. Like consoles, handhelds are dedicated platforms, and share almost the same characteristics. Handheld hardware usually is less powerful than PC or console hardware. Some handheld games from the late 1970s and early 1980s could only play one game. In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of handheld games used cartridges, which enabled them to be used to play many different games.
 " " generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special, large coin-operated   which has one built-in console, controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a  , and audio amplifier and speakers. Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the theme of the game. While most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top games, the users typically sit to play. In the 1990s and 2000s, some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games. In the 1980s,   were businesses in which game players could use a number of arcade video games. In the 2010s, there are far fewer video arcades, but some movie theaters and family entertainment centers still have them.
 The   has also established itself as platform in its own right in the 2000s, while providing a   environment for video games designed to be played on a wide spectrum of platforms. In turn, this has generated new terms to qualify classes of web browser-based games. These games may be identified based on the website that they appear, such as with " " games. Others are named based on the programming platform used to develop them, such as   and   games.
 With the advent of standard operating systems for mobile devices such as   and   and devices with greater hardware performance,   has become a significant platform. These games may utilize unique features of mobile devices that are not necessary present on other platforms, such as   and camera devices to support   gameplay. Mobile games also led into the development of   as a valid revenue model for casual games.
  (VR) games generally require players to use a special   that provides   and   to immerse a player within virtual environment that responds to their head movements. Some VR systems include control units for the player's hands as to provide a direct way to interact with the virtual world. VR systems generally require a separate computer, console, or other processing device that couples with the head-mounted unit.
 A new platform of video games emerged in late 2017 in which users could take ownership of game assets ( ) using   technologies.  An example of this is  . 
 A video game, like most other forms of media, may be categorized into  . Video game genres are used to categorize video games based on their gameplay interaction rather than   or narrative differences.  A video game genre is defined by a set of gameplay challenges and are classified independent of their   or game-world content, unlike other works of fiction such as films or books. For example, a   is still a shooter game, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space. 
 Because genres are dependent on content for definition, genres have changed and evolved as newer styles of video games have come into existence. Ever advancing technology and production values related to video game development have fostered more lifelike and complex games which have in turn introduced or enhanced genre possibilities (e.g., virtual pets), pushed the boundaries of existing video gaming or in some cases add new possibilities in play (such as that seen with games specifically designed for devices like Sony's  ). Some genres represent combinations of others, such as   (MOBA), and   (MMORPG). It is also common to see higher level genre terms that are collective in nature across all other genres such as with action, music/rhythm or horror-themed video games. 
 Casual games derive their name from their ease of accessibility, simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets. Additionally, casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand. Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the   operating system. Examples of   within this category are  ,  ,  ,   or many of the   style games. Casual games are generally available through   and online retailers such as   and   or provided for free play through   such as  . While casual games are most commonly played on personal computers, phones or tablets, they can also be found on many of the on-line console system download services (e.g., the  ,   or  ).
 Serious games are games that are designed primarily to convey information or a learning experience to the player. Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game in the traditional sense of the term. Educational software does not typically fall under this category (e.g.,   tutors, language learning programs, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear to be based on the game's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule. Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as  ,  , or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.
 One of the longest-running serious games franchises is  , first published in 1982 under that name. The United States military uses  -based simulations, such as VBS1 for training exercises,  as do a growing number of first responder roles (e.g., police, firefighters, EMTs).  One example of a non-game environment utilized as a platform for serious game development would be the virtual world of  , which is currently used by several United States governmental departments (e.g.,  ,  ,  ), Universities (e.g.,  ,  ) for educational and remote learning programs  and businesses (e.g.,  ,  ) for meetings and training. 
  in video games plays a crucial role in making a statement or conveying a message on important relevant issues. This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be  . These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point.  For example, Take Action Games is a game studio collective that was co-founded by Susana Ruiz and has made successful serious games. Some of these games include  ,  , and  . All of these games bring awareness to important issues and events. 
 On 23 September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama launched a campaign called "Educate to Innovate" aimed at improving the technological, mathematical, scientific and engineering abilities of American students. This campaign states that it plans to harness the power of interactive games to help achieve the goal of students excelling in these departments.  This campaign has stemmed into many new opportunities for the video game realm and has contributed to many new competitions. Some of these competitions include the Stem National Video Game Competition and the  .  Both of these bring a focus to relevant and important current issues through gaming. www.NobelPrize.org entices the user to learn about information pertaining to the Nobel prize achievements while engaging in a fun video game.  There are many different types and styles of educational games, including counting to spelling to games for kids, to games for adults. Some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game.
 Video game can use several types of input devices to translate human actions to a game, the most common game controllers are keyboard and mouse for " , consoles usually come with specific  , handheld consoles have built in buttons. Other game controllers are commonly used for specific games like  ,   or  .   can also be used as game controllers capturing movements of the body of the player.
 As technology continues to advance, more can be added onto the controller to give the player a more immersive experience when playing different games. There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. Along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. Most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking. The companies that design the controllers are trying to make the controller visually appealing and also feel comfortable in the hands of the consumer.
 An example of a technology that was incorporated into the controller was the  . It allows the player to be able to interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the player's path. Another example is   where a person's movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the player moves around in front of it, and the actions are repeated by a game character.
 Video game development and authorship, much like any other form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field.  , as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include   and  . Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including  , musicians, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the  . All of these are managed by  .
 In the early days of the industry, it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game. As platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present, larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art, programming, cinematography, and more. This is not to say that the age of the "one-man shop" is gone, as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets,  where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited   or lack of dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform (e.g., some  ). 
 With the growth of the size of development teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450.  The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products. 
 A phenomenon of additional game content at a later date, often for additional funds, began with digital video game distribution known as downloadable content (DLC). Developers can use   to issue new storylines after the main game is released, such as   with   (  and  ), or Bethesda with   and  . New gameplay modes can also become available, for instance,   and its zombie modes,  a multiplayer mode for   or a higher difficulty level for  . Smaller packages of DLC are also common, ranging from better in-game weapons ( ,  ), character outfits ( ,  ), or new songs to perform ( ,  ,  ).
 A variation of downloadable content is expansion packs. Unlike DLC, expansion packs add a whole section to the game that either already exists in the game's code or is developed after the game is released. Expansions add new maps, missions, weapons, and other things that weren't previously accessible in the original game. An example of an expansion is  's  , which had the   expansion. The expansion added new weapons, new maps, and higher levels, and remade old missions.
 Expansions are added to the base game to help prolong the life of the game itself until the company is able to produce a sequel or a new game altogether. Developers may plan out their game's life and already have the code for the expansion in the game, but inaccessible by players, who later unlock these expansions, sometimes for free and sometimes at an extra cost. Some developers make games and add expansions later, so that they could see what additions the players would like to have. There are also expansions that are set apart from the original game and are considered a stand-alone game, such as  's expansion  , which features a different character than the original game.
 Many games produced for the PC are designed such that technically oriented consumers can modify the game. These   can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest. Developers such as  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   ship their games with some of the development tools used to make the game, along with documentation to assist mod developers. The Internet provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute mods, and they may be a factor in the commercial success of some games.  This allows for the kind of success seen by popular mods such as the   mod  .
 Cheating in computer games may involve   and hidden spots implemented by the game developers,  modification of game code by third parties,  or players exploiting a software glitch. Modifications are facilitated by either   hardware or a software  .  Cheats usually make the game   by providing an unlimited amount of some resource; for example weapons, health, or ammunition; or perhaps the ability to walk through walls.  Other cheats might give access to otherwise unplayable levels or provide unusual or amusing features, like altered game colors or other graphical appearances.
 Software errors not detected by software testers during development can find their way into released versions of computer and video games. This may happen because the glitch only occurs under unusual circumstances in the game, was deemed too minor to correct, or because the game development was hurried to meet a publication deadline. Glitches can range from minor graphical errors to serious bugs that can delete saved data or cause the game to malfunction. In some cases publishers will release updates (referred to as  ) to repair glitches. Sometimes a glitch may be beneficial to the player; these are often referred to as  .
  are hidden messages or jokes left in games by developers that are not part of the main game.  Easter eggs are secret responses that occur as a result of an undocumented set of commands. The results can vary from a simple printed message or image, to a page of programmer credits or a small videogame hidden inside an otherwise serious piece of software. Videogame   are a specific type of Easter egg, in which entering a secret command will unlock special powers or new levels for the player. 
 Although departments of computer science have been studying the technical aspects of video games for years, theories that examine games as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the humanities. The two most visible schools in this emerging field are   and  . Narrativists approach video games in the context of what   calls "Cyberdrama". That is to say, their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that arises out of  . Murray puts video games in the context of the  , a fictional piece of technology from  , arguing for the video game as a medium in which the player is allowed to become another person, and to act out in another world.  This image of video games received early widespread popular support, and forms the basis of films such as  ,   and  .
 Ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea. They argue that a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys.   argues that, although games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are incidental to gameplay. For example, Aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game  , saying that "the dimensions of  's body, already analyzed to death by  , are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make me play differently... When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through it and past it."  Simply put, ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the player.
 While many games rely on  , video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of the game. The term "emergent narrative" has been used to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by "what happens to the player."  However, emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games. In general, any place where event-driven instructions occur for   in a game, emergent behavior will exist. For instance, take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and/or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.
 An emulator is a program that replicates the behavior of a  , allowing games to run on a different platform from the original hardware. Emulators exist for  ,   and   other than the original. Emulators are generally used to play old games,  ,  , or add enhanced features to games like improved graphics, speed up or down, bypass regional lockouts, or online multiplayer support.
 Some manufacturers have released official emulators for their own consoles. For example,     allows users to play games for old Nintendo consoles on the  ,  , and  . Virtual Console is part of Nintendo's strategy for deterring video game piracy.  In November 2015,   launched backwards compatibility of   games on   console via emulation.  Also,   announced relaunching   games on   via emulation.  According to  , creating an emulator for a proprietary video game console is legal.  However, Nintendo claims that emulators promote the distribution of illegally copied games. 
 The November 2005 Nielsen Active Gamer Study, taking a survey of 2,000 regular  , found that the U.S. games market is diversifying. The age group among male players has expanded significantly in the 25–40 age group. For casual online puzzle-style and simple mobile cell phone games, the gender divide is more or less equal between men and women. More recently there has been a growing segment of female players engaged with the aggressive style of games historically considered to fall within traditionally male genres (e.g.,  ). According to the ESRB, almost 41% of PC gamers are women.  Participation among African-Americans is lower. One survey of over 2000 game developers returned responses from only 2.5% who identified as black. 
 When comparing today's industry climate with that of 20 years ago, women and many adults are more inclined to be using products in the industry. While the market for teen and young adult men is still a strong market, it is the other demographics which are posting significant growth. The   (ESA) provides the following summary for 2011 based on a study of almost 1,200 American households carried out by Ipsos MediaCT: 
 A 2006 academic study, based on a survey answered by 10,000 gamers, identified the   (gamers that identify as gay) as a demographic group.  A follow-up survey in 2009 studied the purchase habits and content preferences of people in the group.  Based on the study by NPD group in 2011, approximately 91 percent of children aged 2–17 play games. 
 Video game culture is a worldwide   subculture formed around video games and game playing. As computer and video games have increased in popularity over time, they have had a significant influence on popular culture. Video game culture has also evolved over time hand in hand with   as well as the increasing popularity of  . Many people who play video games identify as  , which can mean anything from someone who enjoys games to someone who is passionate about it. As video games become more social with   and  , gamers find themselves in growing  . Gaming can both be entertainment as well as competition, as a new trend known as   is becoming more widely accepted. In the 2010s, video games and discussions of video game trends and topics can be seen in  , politics, television, film and music.
  are those that can be played either competitively, sometimes in  , or cooperatively by using either multiple input devices, or by  .  , arguably the first video game, was a two player game, as was its successor  . The first commercially available game console, the  , had two controller inputs. Since then, most consoles have been shipped with two or four controller inputs. Some have had the ability to expand to four, eight or as many as 12 inputs with additional adapters, such as the  . Multiplayer   typically feature play for two to four players, sometimes tilting the monitor on its back for a top-down viewing experience allowing players to sit opposite one another.
 Many early computer games for non-PC descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support. Personal computer systems from   and   both regularly featured at least two game ports. PC-based computer games started with a lower availability of multiplayer options because of technical limitations. PCs typically had either one or no game ports at all. Network games for these early personal computers were generally limited to only text based adventures or   that were played remotely on a dedicated server. This was due both to the slow speed of modems (300-1200-bit/s), and the prohibitive cost involved with putting a computer online in such a way where multiple visitors could make use of it. However, with the advent of widespread   technologies and Internet based online capabilities, the number of players in modern games can be 32 or higher, sometimes featuring integrated text and/or voice chat.   (MMOs) can offer extremely high numbers of simultaneous players;   set a record with 65,303 players on a single server in 2013. 
 It has been shown that action video game players have better   and  , such as their resistance to  , their sensitivity to information in the   and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than nonplayers.  Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games, involving challenges that switch attention between different locations, but not with games requiring concentration on single objects.
 In  's book,  , he argues that video games in fact demand far more from a player than traditional games like  . To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, as well as how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and  . Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books.  Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities. 
 Learning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the U.S. education system.  It has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration, they do not realize they are learning, and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school, education would enjoy significant benefits.  Students are found to be "learning by doing" while playing video games while fostering creative thinking. 
 The   has deployed machines such as the   and   vehicles, which make use of a game-style   to make it more familiar for young people.  According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers'   as well as their ability to do problem solving. A study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games. A second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons (82 percent men; 18 percent women) also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first. 
 An experiment carried out by Richard De Lisi and Jennifer Woldorf demonstrates the positive effect that video games may have on spatial skills. De Lisi and Woldorf took two groups of third graders, one control group and one experiment group. Both groups took a paper-and-pencil test of mental rotation skills. After this test, the experiment group only played 11 sessions of the game  . This game was chosen as it requires mental rotation. After this game, both groups took the test again. The result showed that the scores of the experiment group raised higher than that of the control group, thereby confirming this theory. 
 The research showing benefits from action games has been questioned due to methodological shortcomings, such as recruitment strategies and selection bias, potential placebo effects, and lack of baseline improvements in control groups.  In addition, many of the studies are  , and of the   interventional trials, not all have found effects.  A response to this pointed out that the skill improvements from action games are more broad than predicted, such as  , which is not a common task in action games.  Action gamers are not only better at ignoring distractions, but also at focusing on the main task. 
 Like other media, video games have been the subject of objections, controversies, and censorship, for depictions of violence, criminal activities, sexual themes,  , tobacco and other  , propaganda, profanity, or  . Critics of video games include parents' groups, politicians, religious groups, scientists and other  . Claims that some video games cause   or violent behavior continue to be made and to be disputed. 
 There have been a number of societal and scientific arguments about whether the content of video games change the behavior and attitudes of a player, and whether this is reflected in   overall. Since the early 1980s, advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an  , arguing for their protection under the laws governing   and also  . Detractors argue that video games are   and therefore should be  . The positive and negative characteristics and effects of video games are the subject of scientific study. Results of investigations into links between video games and  ,  , violence,  , and a variety of stereotyping and   issues are debated.  A study was done that claimed that young people who have had a greater exposure to violence in video games ended up behaving more aggressively towards people in a social environment. 
 In 2018, the   declared " " a   for people who are addicted to video games.  Some studies have claimed video games can negatively affect health and mental state for some players. 
 In spite of the alleged negative effects of video games, certain studies indicate that they may have value in terms of academic performance, perhaps because of the skills that are developed in the process. "When you play games you’re solving puzzles to move to the next level and that involves using some of the general knowledge and skills in maths, reading and science that you’ve been taught during the day", said Alberto Posso an Associate Professor at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, after analysing data from the results of standardized testing completed by over 12,000 high school students across Australia. As summarized by  ,  the study (published in the  ) "found that students who played online games almost every day scored 15 points above average in maths and reading tests and 17 points above average in science." However, the reporter added an important comment that was not provided by some of the numerous websites that published a brief summary of the Australian study: "[the] methodology cannot prove that playing video games were the cause of the improvement."   also reported that a Columbia University study indicated that extensive video gaming by students in the 6 to 11 age group provided a greatly increased chance of high intellectual functioning and overall school competence.
 In an interview with CNN,  , a professor of Telecommunications at Indiana University Bloomington said he was not surprised by the outcome of the Australian study but also discussed the issue of causal connection. "Though there is a link between gaming and higher math and science scores, it doesn't mean playing games caused the higher scores. It could just be that kids who are sharp are looking for a challenge, and they don't find it on social media, and maybe they do find it on board games and video games," he explained. 
 Video games have also been proven to raise self-esteem and build confidence. It gives people an opportunity to do things that they cannot do offline, and to discover new things about themselves. There is a social aspect to gaming as well – research has shown that a third of video game players make good friends online. As well as that, many video games can also considered to be therapeutic as they can help to relieve stress.  Although short term, studies have shown that children with   gain a temporary physical improvement in health when they interact and play video games on a regular, and consistent basis due to the cognitive benefits and the use of hand eye coordination. 
  (SDT) is a macro theory of human motivation based around competence, autonomy, and relatedness to facilitate positive outcomes.  SDT provides a framework for understanding the effects of playing video games; well-being, problem solving, group relations, physical activities.  These factors can be measured to determine the effect video games can have on people. 
 The ability to create an ideal image of one's self and being given multiple options to change that image gives a sense of satisfaction. This topic has much controversy; it is unknown whether this freedom can be beneficial to one's character or detrimental. With increased game usage, a player can become too invested in a fictionally generated character, where the desire to look that way overpowers the enjoyment of the game.  Players see this character creation as entertainment and a release, creating a self-image they could not obtain in reality, bringing comfort outside of the game from lack of investment to the fictional character. Problems that arise based on character design may be link to  . 
  can be enhanced through repetition of  , memory games, spatial abilities and attention control.  Most video games present opportunities to use these skills with the ability to try multiple times even after failure. Many of these skills can be translated to reality and problem solving. This allows the player to learn from mistakes and fully understand how and why a solution to a problem may work. Some researchers believe that continual exposure to challenges may lead players to develop greater persistence over time after a study was shown that frequent players spent more time on puzzles in task that did not involve video games.  Although players were shown to spend more time on puzzles, much of that could have been due to the positive effects of problem solving in games, which involve forming strategy and weighing option before testing a solution. 
 Representatives of Game Academy claim that such games as Civilization, Total War, or X-Com, where strategy and resource management are key, help players to develop skills that are of great use to managers. Also, they found out that IT workers play unusual puzzle games like Portal or tower defense games like Defense Grid more often than specialists from other fields. 
 In a study that followed students through school, students that played video games showed higher levels of problem solving than students who did not.  This contradicts the previous study in that higher success rate was seen in video game players. Time being a factor for problem solving led to different conclusions in the different studies. See   for more.
  being on the rise allows for video game players to communicate and work together in order to accomplish a certain task. Being able to work as a group in a game translates well to reality and jobs, where people must work together to accomplish a task. Research on players in violent and non-violent games show similar results, where the players' relations improved to improve synergy. 
 With the introduction of   and   (virtual reality),   popularity has been increasing, allowing video game players to experience more active rather than sedentary game play.  Mobile apps have tried to expand this concept with the introduction of   which involves walking to progress in the game. Due to   being relatively new, there is still much to be researched. No major differences were seen in tests with children that played on the Wii vs. a non-active game after 12 weeks.  Testing a larger range of ages may show better results.
 Cognitive remediation therapies using tailored video games to improve cognitive deficits, which are associated with poorer outcomes, have a well established efficacy.  Recent studies show that commercial video games modify similar brain areas to these specialized training programs.  Such games may help in the treatment of schizophrenia. 
 Video game laws vary from country to country. Console manufacturers usually exercise tight control over the games that are published on their systems, so unusual or special-interest games are more likely to appear as  . Free, casual, and   are usually played on available computers, mobile phones, tablet computers or  .
 Various organisations in different regions are responsible for giving   to video games.
 The   (ESRB) gives video games maturity ratings based on their content. For example, a game might be rated "T" for "Teen" if the game contained obscene words or violence. If a game contains explicit violence or sexual themes, it is likely to receive an   for "Mature" rating, which means that no one under 17 should play it. The rating "A/O", for "Adults Only", indicates games with massive violence or nudity. There are no laws that prohibit children from purchasing "M" rated games in the United States.  Laws attempting to prohibit minors from purchasing "M" rated games were established in California,  ,  ,  , and  , but all were overturned on the grounds that these laws violated the First Amendment.  However, many stores have opted to not sell such games to children anyway.  One of the most controversial games of all time,   by Rockstar Studios, was given an   by the ESRB until Rockstar could make the content more suitable for a mature audience.
  (PEGI) is a system that was developed to standardize the game ratings in all of Europe (not just  , although the majority are EU members), the current members are: all EU members, except Germany and the 10 accession states;  ;  . Iceland is expected to join soon, as are the 10 EU accession states. For all PEGI members, they use it as their sole system, with the exception of the UK, where if a game contains certain material,  it must be rated by  . The PEGI ratings are legally binding in   and it is a criminal offence to sell a game to someone if it is rated above their age. 
 Stricter game rating laws mean that Germany does not operate within the PEGI. Instead, they adopt their own system of certification which is required by law. The   (USK) checks every game before release and assigns an age rating to it – either none (white), 6 years of age (yellow), 12 years of age (green), 16 years of age (blue) or 18 years of age (red). It is forbidden for anyone, retailers, friends or parents alike, to allow a child access to a game for which he or she is underage. If a game is considered to be harmful to young people (for example because of extremely violent, pornographic or racist content), it may be referred to the   (BPjM) who may opt to place it on the Index upon which the game may not be sold openly or advertised in the open media. It is considered a felony to supply these games to a child.
 The   (CERO) that rates video games and   (except  ,  , and  ) in   with levels of rating that informs the customer of the nature of the product and for what age group it is suitable. It was established in July 2002 as a branch of  , and became an officially recognized   in 2003. These ratings are:
 According to the market research firm SuperData, as of May 2015, the global games market was worth US$74.2 billion. By region, North America accounted for $23.6 billion, Asia for $23.1 billion, Europe for $22.1 billion and South America for $4.5 billion. By market segment,   were worth $22.3 billion, retail games 19.7 billion,     8.7 billion,   $7.9 billion, PC   7.5 billion, and other categories $3 billion or less each. 
 In the United States, also according to SuperData, the share of video games in the entertainment market grew from 5% in 1985 to 13% in 2015, becoming the third-largest market segment behind broadcast and cable television. The research firm anticipated that Asia would soon overtake North America as the largest video game market due to the strong growth of free-to-play and mobile games. 
 Sales of different types of games vary widely between countries due to local preferences. Japanese consumers tend to purchase much more   than   and especially  , with a strong preference for games catering to local tastes.  Another key difference is that, despite the  ,   remain an important sector of the  .   , computer games are generally preferred over console games, especially   games and   games. Computer games are also popular in China. 
  are an important showcase of the industry. The annual   in   in August is the world's leading expo for video games in attendance.  The   in June in Los Angeles is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.  The   in September is the main fair in Asia. Other notable conventions and trade fairs include   in October,   in October–November,   (Australia) in October,  ,   in July and the annual  .

 Short for electronic sports, are video game competitions played most by professional players individually or in teams that gained popularity from the late 2000s, the most common genres are  ,   (FPS),   (MOBA) and  . There are certain games that are made for just competitive multiplayer purposes. With those type of games, players focus entirely on choosing the right character or obtaining the right equipment in the game to help them when facing other players. Tournaments are held so that people in the area or from different regions can play against other players of the same game and see who is the best.   (MLG) is a company that reports tournaments that are held across the country. The players that compete in these tournaments are given a rank depending on their skill level in the game that they choose to play in and face other players that play that game. The players that also compete are mostly called professional players for the fact that they have played the game they are competing in for many, long hours. Those players have been able to come up with different strategies for facing different characters. The professional players are able to pick a character to their liking and be able to master how to use that character very effectively. With  , players tend to know how to get resources quick and are able to make quick decisions about where their troops are to be deployed and what kind of troops to create.
 Creators will nearly always copyright their games. Laws that define copyright, and the rights that are conveyed over a video game vary from country to country. Usually a   copyright clause allows consumers some ancillary rights, such as for a player of the game to stream a game online. This is a vague area in copyright law, as these laws predate the advent of video games. This means that rightsholders often must define what they will allow a consumer to do with the video game.
 There are many video game museums around the world, including the   in  ,  which serves as the largest museum wholly dedicated to the display and preservation of the industry's most important artifacts.  Europe hosts video game museums such as the   in Berlin  and the   in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg.

The   in Washington, DC has three video games on permanent display:  ,  , and  . 
 The   has added a total of   to its permanent Architecture and Design Collection since 2012.  In 2012, the   ran an exhibition on " ".  However, the reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.

Stress-test your knowledge with quizzes that help commit syntax to memory Offered By This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.  The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”.  Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Python 3. Install Python and write your first program Describe the basics of the Python programming language Use variables to store, retrieve and calculate information Utilize core programming tools such as functions and loops The mission of the University of Michigan is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future. These are the course-wide materials as well as the first part of Chapter One where we explore what it means to write programs.  We finish Chapter One and have the quiz and first assignment in the third week of the class. Throughout the course you may want to come back and look at these materials.  This section should not take you an entire week.  In this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs.  Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the "Using Python in this Class" material for details. In the first chapter we try to cover the "big picture" of programming so you get a "table of contents" of the rest of the book.   Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it.   This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in.  You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters. In this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information. In this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped.  It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes "choices". This is a relatively short chapter.   We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them.   The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code. Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.  Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over.   Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved. Extremely well laid out curriculum, to the point videos and excellent book.

 Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the  . Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like   and a garbage collection system with  .
 Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely  , and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
 The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release."  No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.  With Python 2's  , only  Python 3.5.x  and later are supported.
 Python   are available for many  . A global community of programmers develops and maintains  , a    . A non-profit organization, the  , manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.
 Python was conceived in the late 1980s  by   at   (CWI) in the   as a successor to the   (itself inspired by  ),  capable of   and interfacing with the   operating system.  Its implementation began in December 1989.  Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's  , a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.  He now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person steering council.  In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project. 
 Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a     and support for  . 
 Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely  .  Many of its major features were   to Python 2.6.x  and 2.7.x version series.  Releases of Python 3 include the   utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3. 
 Python 2.7's   date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. 
 Python is a  .   and   are fully supported, and many of its features support   and   (including by   and   (magic methods)).  Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including   and  . 
 Python uses   and a combination of   and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for  .  It also features dynamic   ( ), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
 Python's design offers some support for   in the   tradition. It has  ,  , and   functions;  ,  , sets, and   expressions.  The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from   and  . 
 The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document   ( ), which includes   such as: 
 Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly  . This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with  , which espoused the opposite approach. 
 Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to  's " " motto, Python embraces a "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it" design philosophy.   , a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that "To describe something as 'clever' is   considered a compliment in the Python culture." 
 Python's developers strive to avoid  , and reject patches to non-critical parts of the   reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.  When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use  , a  .   is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.
 An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group  —and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a  ) instead of the standard  . 
 A common   in the Python community is  , which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called  .
 Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as  . 
 Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use   to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than   or  . 
 Python uses   indentation, rather than   or keywords, to delimit  . An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.  Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure.  This feature is sometimes termed the  , which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation doesn't have any semantic meaning.
 Python's   include (among others):
 Python does not support   optimization or  , and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.  However, better support for  -like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's  .  Before 2.5, generators were    ; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels. 
 Some Python   are similar to languages such as   and  , while some are not:
 In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as  ,  , or  . This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:
 Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or  , all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as   cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator   for an equality operator   in conditions:   is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but   causes a syntax error in Python.
  on objects are   attached to the object's class; the syntax   is, for normal methods and functions,   for  . Python methods have an explicit   parameter to access  , in contrast to the implicit   (or  ) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g.,  ,  ,  , or  ). 
 Python uses   and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at  ; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being  , Python is  , forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.
 Python allows programmers to define their own types using  , which are most often used for  . New   of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example,   or  ), and the classes are instances of the     (itself an instance of itself), allowing   and  .
 Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes:   and  .  The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class   is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from   and are instances of  ). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.
 The long term plan is to support   and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named   supports compile-time type checking. 
 
 
 Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators ( ,  ,  ,  ), the floor division operator   and the     (where the remainder can be negative,  e.g.  ). It also has   for  , e.g.   and  , and a matrix multiply operator   .  These operators work like in traditional math; with the same  , the operators   (   and   can also be   to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).
 Division between integers produces floating point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time: 
 In Python terms,   is   (or simply  ), and   is     before version 3.0 is  . 
 Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation   is always true. It also means that the equation   is valid for both positive and negative values of  . However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of   is, as expected, in the   [0,  ), where   is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval ( , 0] when   is negative. 
 Python provides a   function for   a float to the nearest integer. For  , Python 3 uses  :   and   both produce  .  Versions before 3 used  :   is  ,   is  . 
 Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression   tests whether   is less than   and   is less than  .   C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate  , resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with  . 
 Python uses   for all integer operations. The   type/class in the   module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.  The   class in the   module provides arbitrary precision for  . 
 Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library   that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.

 Python's large  , commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,  provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as   and   are supported. It includes modules for creating  , connecting to  ,  , arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,  manipulating  , and  .
 Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the   (WSGI) implementation   follows PEP 333 ), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and  . However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.
 As of November 2019,  the   (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 200,000  packages with a wide range of functionality, including:
 Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a   (REPL), permitting them to function as a   for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.

CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including   (Vista and later; supported   and older, with by now unsupported Python 2.7) and most modern   systems. Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities,  in Python 1 and 2 time-frame, even supporting   and  , while since support has been dropped for a lot of platforms.

 Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:
 In 2005,   released a Python interpreter for the   mobile phones named  . It includes many of the modules from the CPython implementations and some additional modules to integrate with the   operating system. The project has been kept up-to-date to run on all variants of the S60 platform, and several third-party modules are available. The Nokia   also supports Python with   widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device. 
 There are several compilers to high-level  , with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language:
 A performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy '13.  Python's performance compared to other programming languages has also been benchmarked by  . 
 Python's development is conducted largely through the   (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions.  Python coding style is covered in PEP 8.  Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council. 
 Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues are discussed in the     hosted at  .  Development originally took place on a   source-code repository running  , until Python moved to   in January 2017. 
 CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:
 Python 3.9 alpha1 was announced in November 2019  and with the adoption of a new yearly release cadence,  the first release of 3.9 is slated for November 2020. 
 Many   are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running the large   suite during development, and using the     system.

 Python's name is derived from the British comedy group  , whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;  for example, the   often used in Python literature are   instead of the traditional  .  The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines. 
 The prefix   is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include  , a   of   to Python (commonly used to create games);   and  , which bind   and   to Python respectively; and  , a Python implementation originally written in Python.

 Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the   where, as of February 2020 , it is the third most popular language (behind  , and  ).  It was selected Programming Language of the Year in 2007, 2010, and 2018. 
 An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often "better than Java and not much worse than C or C++". 
 Large organizations that use Python include  ,  ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,  ,    and some smaller entities like   and  .  The social news networking site   is written entirely in Python.

  regardless of configure flags, the optimized build
process will perform the following steps: The entire Python directory is cleaned of temporary files that may have
resulted from a previous compilation. An instrumented version of the interpreter is built, using suitable compiler
flags for each flavour. Note that this is just an intermediary step.  The

profiling instructions embedded inside. After the instrumented interpreter is built, the Makefile will run a training
workload.  This is necessary in order to profile the interpreter execution.
Note also that any output, both stdout and stderr, that may appear at this step
is suppressed. The final step is to build the actual interpreter, using the information
collected from the instrumented one.  The end result will be a Python binary

Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This   gives enough understanding on   language.  is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.  is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:  − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.  − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.  − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.  − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games. Following are important characteristics of   − It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP. It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications. It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking. It supports automatic garbage collection. It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java. Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I'm going to give you a small conventional Python Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link. As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:  − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.  − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.  − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.  − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.  − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.  − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.  − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.  − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.  − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.  − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting. This   is designed for software programmers who need to learn Python programming language from scratch. You should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the programming languages is a plus. Python is a programming language. Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
