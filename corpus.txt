Tiger Woods’ trophy room is loaded with trophies and other memorabilia. What else would you expect from a 15-time major champion? However, there is at least one item that one would never guess has a special home among Woods’ most prized possessions. In fact, it doesn’t even originally belong to Woods. At the Presidents Cup last December, Woods, in his first stint as captain, led a singles comeback on the final day at Royal Melbourne, the victory being clinched by Matt Kuchar on the 17  hole. After the winning putt, which guaranteed a deciding half-point, Kuchar’s caddie, John Wood, took the ball out of play as Kuchar played the final hole and decided to gift it to Woods. “He gave me the ball when we were on 18, which is really cool,” Woods said  . “This was the winning ball to clinch the cup on the 17th hole. … Very special to me.” So, there you have it: Kuchar’s ball isn’t in Kuchar’s trophy case, it’s in Woods’ collection.

 Tuesday 28 July 2020 18:20, UK Tigers have made a "remarkable comeback" in five countries, a decade after the launch of an ambitious project to double the population of the endangered species. Conservationists say there has been an increase of the animals in the wild across Bhutan, China, India, Nepal and Russia, 10 years on from the start of the TX2 initiative. In 2010, it was estimated that wild populations of the big cat were at an historic low, with as few as 3,200 remaining across the 13 "range" countries where they are found. The scheme aims to double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022, the next Chinese Year of the Tiger. In India, the number of wild tigers more than doubled from 2006 to 2018, with estimates of between 2,600 and 3,350 of the animals in the country. Nepal's population of tigers went up from 121 in 2009, to 235 in almost a decade. In the country's Bardia National Park alone, the numbers jumped from just 18 in 2008, to 87 in 2018, according to wildlife charity WWF. "Ten years ago, tigers were in such a perilous state that there was a very real risk of them becoming extinct in the wild", said Becci May, regional manager of Asian Big Cats at WWF UK. She added: "From that population low in 2010, they are finally making a remarkable comeback in much of South Asia, Russia and China, thanks to co-ordinated and concerted conservation efforts in these countries. "This is an achievement that not only offers a future for tigers in the wild, but for the landscapes they inhabit and the communities living alongside this iconic big cat." In Russia, Amur tiger numbers have increased by 15% in the past 10 years, to around 540 animals, and in Bhutan's Royal Manas National Park, the population rose from only 10 tigers a decade ago, to 22 in 2019. In 2010, China had no more than 20 wild tigers, most of which had crossed the border from Russia. But the country recorded a landmark moment in 2014, when camera traps captured footage of a tigress and her cubs in Jilin Wangqing Nature Reserve, indicating that tigers were breeding in China again and dispersing into new areas. The WWF says that there are still only around 3,900 tigers in the wild, where they are under threat from poaching for the illegal wildlife trade, and the destruction and breaking up of their habitat across much of their range. The organisation says the key to helping wild tiger populations recover is to focus on conserving landscapes where they can thrive and ensure communities in these wildlife-rich areas are supported and included in conservation.

  He was up there somewhere, at the top of the hill, the man Karl Ammann had come to see. It would soon be night. The forest was all shadows and sounds. Ammann had driven across the country to reach this remote river village, and now he was finally here, looking to the top of the hill, ready to confront the person he believed had murdered more tigers than anyone in Laos. In the distance, he could hear them: dozens of tigers roaring.
       300 MILES CHina Myanmar Laos Vientiane Thailand Cambodia Gulf of Thailand Detail 
		For nearly five years, Ammann, 70, a Swiss counter-trafficking conservationist, had tracked the tiger butcher, a man named Nikhom Keovised. He had placed hidden cameras inside what had once been the largest tiger farm in Southeast Asia, an illegal operation where tigers had been raised to one end — slaughter — and where the man doing the slaughtering had been Nikhom. And he had listened to Nikhom describe it all in his own words: “Use the anesthetic,” he had said. “Then just cut the neck.” Then “peel its skin.”
	 
		Now Nikhom had established himself here, in this half-splash of civilization near the Vietnam border, where he’d just opened what his boss — considered one of the nation’s biggest wildlife traffickers — described as a zoo, but what Ammann suspected was a front for selling tigers.
	 
		Ammann knew the risks. He was in the country without permission to investigate its wildlife practices. He was unarmed. Neither Nikhom nor his boss, who didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment, had ever been charged with anything, let alone arrested. If discovered, the equipment Ammann had with him — the drone, the hidden cameras, the satellite images of the country’s tiger farms — would immediately unravel his cover story, that he was a tourist here on a lark.
	 
		But he could already feel the familiar intensity. It had driven him to undertake dozens of risky, self-funded investigations, pushed him to the fringes of the conservation community and caused even friends to describe him as obsessive, if not a little crazy. He couldn’t stop. Those responsible had to be held to account. Species by species, the world is rapidly undergoing an ecological transformation, becoming barely recognizable from the planet it was a few centuries ago. It is a world reckoning with an end of wildness, where humanity and domesticated animals account for almost all mammal biomass, and the tiger, whose captive population now dwarfs its numbers in the wild, is on the verge of becoming a fully industrialized commodity.
	 
		For 10 days late last year, I joined Ammann on an undercover journey to the core of the modern tiger economy to determine whether Laos, a global hub of wildlife trafficking, had fulfilled its promises since 2016 to stamp out the wildlife trade. The trip had been dangerous from the beginning, and then gotten riskier, and now we’d arrived to this hill, where, above, the tigers were becoming louder.
	 
		They were hungry, Ammann announced. It would soon be time to feed them. He slung his camera over his shoulder and started up the hill, in search of tigers and their warden.

		Over the past century or so, the tiger population has plunged in the wild, dropping from an estimated 100,000 to fewer than 4,000, while the number in captivity has exploded to more than 12,500. Nowhere else is the animal’s commodification more complete than in tiger farming, where it is raised, butchered for parts and sold for tens of thousands of dollars. And nowhere else have these farms operated with greater impunity than in Laos, an obscure communist nation whose own wild tigers have nearly all been killed. Ammann was one of the few people who’d seen inside the country’s farms.

		When I’d first spoken to him in June of last year, I’d expected to find someone who was, if not optimistic, then at least hopeful. In a smattering of countries in South Asia, the tiger’s population appeared to be stabilizing, even as it cratered elsewhere. And since 2016, international authorities and some conservationists had applauded Laos, home to some of Asia’s biggest wildlife traffickers, as it announced overhauls to finally clean up the trade. Shops trading in bones and wildlife merchandise were to cease. All three of the country’s illegal tiger farms, which stored 700 tigers, were ordered to stop farming and convert into zoos and conservation centers. No new facilities breeding endangered wildlife for commercial purposes would open. From the outside, things seemed to be getting a bit better. Even Britain’s Prince William had reportedly taken up the cause.
	 
		But Ammann was neither optimistic nor hopeful, and, if anything, seemed offended by the suggestion. In our first substantive phone conversation, he immediately plunged into the arcana of tiger farming in Laos, citing operational tiger farms and going on and on about “lip service” and how we were being taken for “bloody fools.” While Ammann vented, I searched for images of him. He looked the same in every one: mustachioed and grimacing, an expression of the frustration and futility in his voice.

		“They all want hope and happy endings,” he said of producers and audiences who ignored his documentaries, despite their findings. “And I don’t see any happy endings. I can’t create fiction from what I see as fact.”
	 
		We ended the phone call, with him promising to send me some photographs and documents from a trip he’d just taken to Laos to work on a   about tiger trafficking. I felt dazed. Who was that guy? And if he didn’t feel there was any hope, why did he assume so much risk going into some of the world’s most remote forests, without institutional support or funding, to document the destruction?
	 
		From then on, in interviews with conservationists about tiger trafficking, I saved a few questions for the end: Just what do you think of Ammann? Almost everyone I asked immediately knew who Ammann was and said his findings were sound. He could be trusted — but.
	 
		But what?
	 
		“He takes a lot of risks,” Steve Galster, a counter-trafficking expert in Bangkok, said after a long pause.
	 
		“A difficult character,” said Crawford Allan, a senior director at World Wildlife Fund, an international conservation organization with an office in Washington. Ammann had been kicked out of an international conservation meeting for aggressively confronting officials and was known to send environmentalists notes denigrating their work after they’d just trumpeted it in press releases.
	 
		“A bit of a kook who gets results,” a law enforcement consultant in Laos, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, called him.
	 
		Ammann had sent me some of those results. I pulled up the documents and photographs on my computer, and immediately recoiled.

		Two more were from high above, where Ammann had flown a drone to capture images of two massive tiger farms, showing the animals in cage after cage. He included a 3,700-word missive he’d dispatched to the U.N. commission charged with regulating the wildlife trade, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), accusing the organization of being “a big part of the problem.” He’d sent the same letter to a European Parliament official, attaching this comment: “So you cannot say you did not know. My motto for doing this.”
	 
		I called Ammann, who was home in his estate at the base of Mount Kenya, where he keeps as “dependents” two orphaned chimpanzees. I asked whether he was planning on going to Laos again. He said he was — and it would be before year’s end. In the coming weeks, in fact, he’d have the itinerary all planned out. This time, he hoped to take his investigation even further, stepping out from behind the hidden cameras to personally meet those who’d profited from the death of the tiger.
	 
		“Why don’t you come,” he asked, “and see for yourself?”
	 
		After a 24-hour flight, I arrived at my hotel in northern Thailand past midnight. There was a note waiting for me from Ammann. We’d planned to meet the next morning at 8, given my late arrival, but now the note said that wasn’t early enough. We had to meet at 7. A long day was ahead, and there was no time to waste.
	 
		After a fast handshake and a few quick words in the morning, we were inside a van, bumping toward the Laos border. My editors and I had decided that I would enter the country without identifying myself as a journalist, an exception to The Washington Post’s usual practice. I would travel with Ammann and planned to accompany him everywhere, taking notes and quietly snapping photos. If someone asked about my profession or my employer, I knew I’d have to answer truthfully. But no one did.
	 
		Ammann wanted to cross into the country by nightfall, where he said the real journey would begin. Landlocked and mountainous, Laos has nearly 1,600 miles of borders with Vietnam and China, whose appetite for illicit wildlife products had both decimated numerous species and transformed Laos into a global epicenter of wildlife trade. Last October, the U.S. State Department again listed Laos as one of three countries whose government “actively engaged in or knowingly profited” from trafficking endangered species. CITES in a 2017 report was even blunter: “Everyone can buy everything and cross the border.”
	 Traveling across central Laos. 
		Over the next 10 days, Ammann planned to traverse much of the country, beginning in a northern region called the Golden Triangle to visit a casino town notorious for wildlife trafficking and investigate rumors of a never-before-identified tiger enclosure. And then he’d head south, stopping to buy tiger products from merchants in the country’s biggest cities, fly drones over tiger farms and search for clues involving the mysterious disappearance of 300 tigers from one of them. Lastly, he’d venture to a new resort and “zoo” named Say Namthurn, where Ammann hoped to finally meet Nikhom, the tiger butcher, along with his boss, Sakhone Keosouvanh, who helped bring tiger farming to Laos.
	 
		Inside the van now, along with Ammann, were his cameraman, Phil Hattingh, a towering South African; and a young Chinese woman named Grace Chan. Ammann had met Chan, who’s from Hong Kong, in autumn 2017, after she’d contacted him to discuss elephant trafficking. She’d told him she wanted to save animals, so he had introduced her to what he believed was the best way of doing that — his way.
	 
		“They’ll think you’re a customer,” Ammann said to Chan, explaining his plan for her on this trip. “I have the perfect cover story for you.” She was to visit shops all over Laos while wearing a hidden camera to buy tiger products, masquerading as a young assistant to a Hong Kong businessman who wanted tiger parts to impress his friends. To bolster her expertise on the tiger economy, Ammann would soon pull out a tattered book and hand it to her.
	 
		It was a taxonomy of tiger bones, showing pictures of the skull, femur, tibia, hip. The book described the bones as a “precious crude medicine,” whose medicinal use in China traced back more than 1,400 years. But as China’s economy grew, the animal’s mythical qualities — none of which are substantiated by modern medicine — ignited a market for tiger products that, the book said, “sold well domestically and abroad.”
	 
		So well, in fact, that within years of the book’s 1979 publication, a country as vast as China estimated it had only a few dozen tigers left, and something needed to be done. The Chinese government passed a law that banned killing endangered species in the wild while encouraging their “domestication” and breeding. The idea was that the farms would expand the tiger population, sating demand for tiger products while protecting those in the wild. But that wasn’t what happened. Instead, demand exploded further, said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who’s studied the industry, inciting rampant poaching of wild tigers all over Asia and ushering in an era of “catastrophic consumption.”
	 Captive tigers soon outnumbered those in the wild, as habitat loss accelerated and a supply chain of poaching and farming spread across the continent. Using nearly every part of the tiger, a growing collection of “medicines” and improbable luxury products followed. 
		There were efforts to get things under control. Chinese officials in 1993 prohibited domestic trade in tiger bone but didn’t close the country’s many farms, which by 2007 warehoused more than 5,000 tigers. That year, CITES, an international authority with few enforcement tools, banned tiger farming for commercial purposes. China chafed against the restrictions then, and now. Last autumn, it legalized trade in tiger parts for medicinal purposes but, under international pressure, quickly reinstated its ban.
	 
		To bypass it, some Chinese customers flock to border towns sprinkled throughout the Golden Triangle area, where the countries of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand converge, and where weaker rule of law and government corruption abet black market wildlife trade. That was exactly what Ammann wanted to investigate first.
	 
		We drove into the night, passing miles of undeveloped countryside, until a city sprang out of the blackness like a vision. Lexuses and Mercedes wheeled down its streets with license plates from all over China. Big hotels blinked with green and red lights. People swarmed around a large casino with a crown of gold at the town’s center.

		Known as the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone, this sliver of Bokeo Province is controlled by a transnational criminal operation that “engages in an array of horrendous illicit activities,” including child prostitution and human, drug and wildlife trafficking, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, which last year imposed sanctions on the network. “Sin city,”  the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency, a non-governmental organization, called the zone in a 2015 report — a “lawless playground” where an exclusive clientele of Chinese tourists could buy tiger parts in shops and eat tiger meat at restaurants. Just about the only Lao element of the town was geography. Clocks here were set to Beijing time, business was done in renminbi, and the dominant language was Mandarin.

		On our first morning here, I could tell Ammann was already exasperated. His driver was not going fast enough, no matter how many times Ammann told him to pick it up. His computer had stopped working. The hotel where we’d spent the night before — the only one that still took Western guests following the U.S. sanctions — had just told us to clear out. And now Chan was running late.
	 
		“Come on, Grace,” he said, waiting outside the hotel for her.
	 
		“Come on, Grace,” he said, less than a minute later.
	 
		“We’ve got to go,” he said again.
	 
		“Tell her to come,” he finally snapped, directing his Lao guide to go get her.
	 
		Chan finally got into the van, and Ammann told the driver to get moving.
	 
		He knew how he sometimes sounded, but there was no time for niceties, not while the world was committing suicide. In conversations, he frequently brought up environmental studies he’d just read, all of them apparently grim. Between 1970 and 2014, vertebrate populations dropped in size an average of 60 percent. One million plant and animal species now face extinction. The planet could soon lose 60 percent of primate species, according to a study in the peer-reviewed journal, Science Advances, noting how bush-meat hunting had sped their demise — a revelation that, to Ammann, wasn’t a revelation at all. It was his origin story.
	 Karl Ammann, far left, and his cameraman, Phil Hattingh, in eastern Laos. 
		In 1988, Ammann was in a long boat chugging up the Congo River in what was then Zaire. By then, he’d already spent two decades in Africa, where he had worked as a hotelier and photographer, eventually becoming wealthy opening and selling an eco-tourism camp in Kenya’s Maasai Mara National Reserve. But along the river’s banks, he saw an Africa he didn’t know. Hundreds of slaughtered primates were strewn near the water’s edge, awaiting transport to nearby markets to be sold as bush meat. Deforestation had provided hunters with access to animals previously protected by dense jungle, giving rise to an underground economy.
	 
		The bush-meat hunts, the markets, the outrage he’d felt at their discovery: It soon consumed him. In the early 1990s, at a time when little was known about the bush-meat trade, he went to remote merchants and logging encampments, looking for apes orphaned by bush-meat hunters, and returned with gruesome images that few could stomach. Decapitated gorillas. Charbroiled monkeys. Butchered chimpanzees. His photography blurred into activism. He published books, lobbied governments, led international petitions against wildlife slaughter and took nearly every media opportunity that came his way. He described it all as graphically as he could, hoping to shock people into action. “Up to their elbows in blood,” he said of bush-meat hunters in one 1995 newspaper interview. It was “98.5 cannibalism” to eat chimps, he said in another. “Maybe I’ve become too extreme,” he confessed in one more, and many conservationists then agreed.
	 
		Jane Goodall, the renowned chimpanzee conservationist, said he was too aggressive, and he said she wasn’t aggressive enough. Other conservationists accused him of “cultural imperialism,” and he countered that they worried more about fundraising than truth.
	 
		“He won’t stop,” says his wife, Kathy, even after his findings were substantiated, and he was named a Time magazine Hero of the Environment in 2007 for “almost single-handedly raising awareness of the issue of bush meat,” and was told again and again to slow down. His marriage was suffering. Commitment had collided with obsession. “Just part of the furniture” was how Kathy said she’d come to feel, seeing him at the computer, emailing and researching all day. Two personalities jostle inside him, said Dale Peterson, a former collaborator. He was one person around people — combative, cynical, “miserable,” as Peterson put it — and another around animals. That was the Ammann who’d for decades cared for a chimpanzee he’d saved from hunters, or who would stop and discuss even a small bird, he said, “in the most affectionate way.” He was “driven by something larger.”
	 
		That intensity building within, he pulled up to the market along the Mekong River, straddling the Lao-Thai border. The door opened, out Chan went, and from the market entrance, Ammann watched her disappear into the stalls.
	 
		She was dressed in black. Black hat. Black sunglasses. Black blouse, the top button of which concealed the camera. Ammann wanted us to keep our distance from her at first, knowing the illegal wildlife trade had increasingly receded from public view, just as it once had with bush meat. Sellers these days store their jewelry and medicine in backrooms and hidden drawers that open only for wealthy Chinese customers — which was how Ammann hoped Chan would appear. He followed her into the market.
	 We met her near the back, at the counter of an open-air store named Exotic Family. There, a thin Chinese salesman was drinking tea, wearing rings on both hands, saying, yes, he had tiger parts to sell. We watched him light a cigarette, and out came a small, hollowed tiger bone with intricate carvings: $223. Also a tiger claw: $223. And two tiger fangs: $1,340. 
		Ammann asked to see more. The man pulled out his phone and sent a contact request on the messaging app WeChat to Chan, who held up the screen for Ammann and myself to see.
	 
		She already knew the digital netherworld of wildlife trading, where all she needed to do was enter a few keywords — “jelly” for ivory, “king” for tiger products — to thwart a blanket prohibition on the trade on China’s leading commerce sites. The ban, instituted in 2012, had gotten rid of a lot of the listings, but it hadn’t gotten rid of them all, not with an evolving lexicon of code words and not with social media, where much of the trade has migrated and is more difficult to detect. Elephant-skin powder pills, black-bear gallbladder bile and tiger-bone jewelry: Chan had seen it all. But one rare product didn’t appear on the seller’s WeChat profile. Did he have any tiger skin for sale?
	 
		“No tiger skins anymore. You can find them in Vietnam,” he said in Chinese. “In Vietnam, there are more tiger farms.”
	 
		“But Laos has a lot of tiger farms, too,” Ammann said.
	 
		“Tigers in Laos are now protected,” the merchant said.
	 
		Ammann looked at him strangely. He knew Laos had vowed to close its tiger farms and stop the trade in wildlife products, but yet here this merchant was, doing just that. So how likely was it that much had changed? The government, after all, had more than two years ago promised a “full audit,” funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to determine the number and origin of the country’s captive tigers. But it had faced numerous delays. And the same tiger breeders the government had previously accused of breaking the law were still involved in the operations, where the tiger population has been fluctuating dramatically, indicating possible trade.

		The number of tigers on one farm named Vannaseng surged from 102 to 235, then fell to 111, according to public records and Lao government documents that I reviewed. Another one called Vinasakhone — where Nikhom had worked — reported a sudden loss of 300 tigers in 2017, shedding three-fourths of its population, without ever explaining how that happened. Then a new and massive farm was disclosed by a Vietnamese news outlet in April 2017 in the central Laos town of Lak Sao and as of last year housed 106 tigers. Lao government officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment to discuss these issues.
	 
		Ammann, walking away from the stall and the market, believed there were even more tiger enclosures now in Laos, which hadn’t yet been identified. One was rumored to be right here in the Golden Triangle: He had to find out whether it was true.
	 
		We drove several miles, coming to a stop on a desolate dirt road wedged between thatched-roof huts and jungle. Ammann got out of the car. This was where an informant had told him to look. Up ahead, he saw a complex of structures behind a tall wall. “Turn the car around,” Ammann said curtly to the driver. “And turn the engine off.” He reached for his camera and approached the walls, from which hung several signs, praising the facility’s supposed role in conservation.
	 
		“Caring rare animals, protect the blue planet,” said one in English.
	 
		“Growing with animals and die without them,” said another, also in English.
	 
		Ammann turned on his camera and held it at his hip.
	 “This must be it,” he said, walking up to the metal gates of a compound said to be controlled by the local criminal syndicate. He started banging. No answer. He banged again, then stuck his camera between a crack in the gates. A young shirtless man came to see what was going on. Ammann decided to bluff his way in. “Tell him Mr. He sent us here,” Ammann directed Chan, who had no idea what he was talking about, but decided to do it anyway. I stood a few feet behind Ammann, waiting for the worker to puncture the cover story and turn us away, but Ammann kept staring at the gate, which was slightly ajar. Ammann vanished beyond the wall. Chan and I looked at each other briefly, unsure, then followed. A sound that I’d never heard before then came into Ammann’s voice, one of joy and wonder. Around the corner, back in the darkness of one of the structures, stripes were moving. Even after all this time, seeing tigers up close like this stunned him. They were so big, moving with the latent energy of coiled springs. I ran to another enclosure to photograph whatever was there. Then a tiger paw streaked out through the bars, and I was yelling, jerking my arm away. The worker wanted us out. He was staring at Ammann, who continued to film. Then I was telling Ammann that we had to leave. The worker was calling his boss again. I didn’t want to be here when he showed up. 
		One more look, and then his camera was down, and he was in the car, and it was pulling away, and he couldn’t help but shake his head.
	 
		“Yeah, but Laos is closing down the tiger farms, isn’t it?” he said.
	 
		Days later, after Chan had bought and filmed tiger parts being sold in shops all over Laos, and after we’d left her in the capital of Vientiane with her job complete, Ammann looked out the van’s window, as the city receded into exurbs. We were heading across the country to the Vietnam border in search of Nikhom at the new resort of Say Namthurn, and he was in a darker mood than usual. “We’re just the biggest parasite this world has ever known,” he said, seeing trash and cars and humanity pressing in from every direction.
	 
		In times like this, he often looked at his life’s work, at all of the risks taken, all the rules broken, all the hours and money and emotion consumed in his investigations, and saw only failure. Endangered animals were still getting killed. The tiger’s range had shrunk to about 7 percent of its historic sweep. And mainstream conservationists: They’d done what? Their attempts to stop poaching, their reintroduction of captive-born predators into the wild, their law enforcement crackdowns — all failures. To Ammann, conservation efforts were almost always doomed, and anyone who said otherwise was either fundraising or a “naive, gullible a—hole with nothing better to do.”
	 
		“It’s frustrating to care about something this much,” Ammann went on. “Am I wasting my time? And if I can’t get people to watch and to care, then I should just shoot myself.”
	 
		Several times during the trip, I’d asked him if he should take it easier. Enjoy his money. Spend more time at home with his wife. Why continue if this made him unhappy, if he thought the work was futile?
	 
		“The real challenge starts when you know, ‘I’m never going to win,’ but you keep going,” he answered once. “It doesn’t make you stupid, or heroic, but something in between. If I’ve had a few bad nights’ sleep over what I’ve seen, well, let me give a few others a bad night’s of sleep. . . . It’s easy to sell hope. But hope without action is an excuse.”

		The van now crossed a muddy river, continuing along Route 8, which streaked into mountains rising sheer against the horizon. The town of Lak Sao soon came into view, and Ammann, seeing an upcoming intersection, said we had to stop, suddenly sounding energized. There was a tiger farm nearby.
	 
		We bounced off the main highway, forked into a quiet village and rolled onto an unmarked dirt path. “This is it,” Ammann said. Just down this road was the Lak Sao tiger farm, with around 100 tigers inside, if not more. Outside the van’s tinted windows, people were resting underneath thatched roofs and stilted homes, and inside, Hattingh, the cameraman, was reaching into his bag. Out came the drone. They had five minutes — 10 tops — to get what they needed and get out.
	 
		“If you see people running, bring it home and get out of there,” Ammann said. “This is one of those things where if you get caught, if they catch you with a drone and no license, they can throw the book at you.”
	 
		Ammann told the driver to turn the van around to allow a fast escape, and Hattingh climbed out, saying, “I’m going to disappear.” He stepped into the bush behind the back of the compound, hidden behind tall concrete walls. The drone, the size of a hawk and buzzing like the world’s loudest cicada, levitated into the air.
	 
		The video beamed back into a handheld screen, showing tigers pacing in their cages, appearing as small as insects. Meanwhile, villagers told Ammann and me about life next to a tiger farm.
	 
		This operation wasn’t like the last one, not another small tiger enclosure hidden away in the hills. This was industrial.
	 
		The drone came down. Hattingh hurried back. I asked the woman her name. She glanced down the road at the farm, then back at me, looking concerned. “Lek,” she offered, and nothing more. She drew a finger across the length of her neck to indicate her fear.
	 
		We got in the van, and Ammann told the driver to hit it.
	 
		Deeper into the countryside we went, mile after mile, land rising into mountains then plunging into ravines, greens and browns washing by, until there came the river village of Tha Bak. On one side of the road, there was a line of small, cavernous houses. On the other side, a sign announced the resort of Say Namthurn, listing its offerings: golf course, drinking water, zoo.
	 
		Ammann got out of the car. He could hear tigers roaring. The sounds were coming from up there, atop a hill shrouded by forest. He reached for his camera.
	 300 MILES CHina Myanmar Laos Vientiane Tha Bak Thailand Cambodia Gulf of Thailand Detail 
		That is where he hoped to find Nikhom.
	 
		Ammann first heard that name in early 2014. He’d been tracking two tiger cubs that had disappeared before he could buy them from a Lao poacher. His investigation had brought him to central Laos, where Vinasakhone, the country’s biggest farm, stored hundreds of tigers behind concrete walls near the Mekong River.
	 
		Its co-owner at the time was a short man named Sakhone Keosouvanh, who hasn’t responded to repeated requests for comment, delivered throughout April by email, messaging services, telephone and certified mail. Unremarkable in appearance but equipped with established government connections, he helped craft Laos’s failed plan to save the country’s last tigers and represented tiger farmers at an international tiger preservation meeting. His farm promoted itself as helping to preserve the tiger population.
	 Sakhone Keosouvanh. 
		Meanwhile, tiger breeding, killing and selling was going on inside those walls, according to Laos government reports I’ve reviewed, and the man who oversaw much of it was Nikhom, who also hasn’t responded to numerous requests for comment.
	 
		Nikhom was the one who met with an investigator Ammann had sent into the farm equipped with a hidden camera and the cover story that he was there to inquire about four tigers — three females and one male — for a farm that his “millionaire” Chinese boss wanted to build.
	 
		“We are happy to sell some for you,” Nikhom had said, according to a transcription of the recording translated into English. The farm, he explained, could transport them to the Chinese border by two means. One was by helicopter — “We use the army helicopter,” he said. “Or we can sell them in pieces.”
	 
		“What do you mean ‘pieces’?” the investigator asked, taken aback. “Then the tigers would be dead.”
	 
		“That’s what we normally do,” Nikhom responded, before backtracking, seemingly worried about divulging too much. “I think we need to agree to the price first before we talk about other things.”
	 
		Over the coming months, the investigator, who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety, would often call Nikhom at Ammann’s prompting. The two men soon developed a friendship. The investigator would take Nikhom out for drinks, then secretly record their conversations about women, beer and tigers. “It always cost me,” Ammann later groused. “A lot of alcohol and meals on my invoice.” Soon the investigator was loaning Nikhom money, they were calling each other “brother,” and Nikhom was delving into how tigers were illegally bred, killed and harvested for parts at a level that staggered Ammann.
	 
		During the first 10 months of 2014 alone, the farm known as Vinasakhone traded an extraordinary amount — nearly 11 tons — of lion and tiger bone, the former of which is sometimes passed off as tiger bone, according to one government document by the Lao Division of Forest Inspection that I obtained. The report, first reported by the Guardian, accused the farm of breaking international and local law. But no action could be taken against it. The farm had “approval from government,” which imposed an extra tax of 2 percent on all wildlife exports, according to a 2003 Laos customs document that I received from an investigator connected to Thai intelligence. A 2016 confidential survey of the country’s wildlife farms by the Lao Department of Forest Resource Management, which I also reviewed, said the farm wasn’t breeding tigers for “scientific research” — as its permit stated — but for slaughter. “The animal is killed at the farm by knockdown injection, removing all intestines so they keep only the body with skin, bones and meat, covered with plastic sheet for shipment,” the survey said, noting one corpse was believed to go for $30,000.
	 
		“We use this anesthetic” was how Nikhom described the process in a conversation with Ammann’s investigator, which The Post had translated. “They start to walk unstably to the left and right and then fall down.”
	 
		“How do you kill it?” the investigator asked.
	 
		Some have their throats cut. But many clients refuse to buy pierced skin, so “we use the elastic string to tighten its neck . . . until it died.”
	 
		Afterward, some buyers want the meat:
	 “Not like cutting the skin of a cow or buffalo, we need to make it an excellent cut, and when we peel the skin, we must be careful not to pierce it.” ບໍ່ຄືໜັງງົວໜັງຄວາຍ ບໍ່ໃຫ້ເຈີດພຸ້ນເຈິດພີ້ ແລ້ວເວລາເຮົາປາດ ບໍ່ໃຫ້ມັນຊອດ 
		“We have to take out all of its meat,” Nikhom said. “When we eat it, it’s just normal to grill or burn it. Its flesh is normal.”
	 
		Others want the bones: “They want the one with more bones. Some people, when they see the fat one and choose it, they only get the weight. For someone who knows . . . they will select the thin one. They will consider the bone.”
	 
		And others only want a dense block of hardened resin known as tiger glue:
	 
		“We cut the bone again and break the bone into small pieces, and then we boil again,” Nikhom said. “It will take two to three days to boil it. Then we take out the water and refill water many times, and make it really boil. Then we separate the soup. We take out the boiling water and refill, until the bone is soft and easy to break. Then it means it finishes.”
	 
		Boiled or frozen, Ammann realized, dead or alive — tigers had been sold. The operation expanded until 2016, when a new Lao administration came to power and, yielding to international demands, announced in a statement that the farms would close, accusing them of illegally “trading tiger products to international buyers.” Soon after, 300 of Vinasakhone’s 400 tigers vanished. Then Sakhone, the co-owner, abandoned the farm, beginning a new tiger operation out here, near a border checkpoint notorious for wildlife trafficking. And with him, Ammann heard from his investigator, he had brought along his longtime farm manager, Nikhom.
	 
		“If Sakhone is here, we have to be careful,” Ammann said. The tiger farmer had connections up and down the border, Ammann believed, and had been so well protected that he’d never faced charges or consequences despite the government allegations against   of his previous operation. Ammann worried about that power. Our intentions for being there couldn’t be discovered.
	 
		Thinking it would come off as suspicious to charge up the hill to see the tigers, we walked through a tourist attraction bereft of tourists to the restaurant patio along the river. “There he is,” Ammann said softly, seeing him across the patio. Sakhone was turning to face us, then coming our way, wearing a blue button-down, gold ring and watch, with a Toyota Hilux key dangling from his belt loop. For so long, Ammann had known Sakhone only as a name on investigative reports and translated transcripts. But now he was gripping Ammann’s hand and smiling broadly. Sakhone took a seat at our table and looked us over. Beers arrived.
	 
		Ammann, playing the role of tourist, did the talking. Through an interpreter, he asked Sakhone how he’d made his money.
	 
		“An import-export company,” Sakhone said.
	 
		Ammann asked what he exported.
	 
		“Mainly coal,” Sakhone said.
	 
		Ammann later told me he’d had the urge to turn on his camera and confront him, just like he had confronted so many others. He wanted to tell him that he’d actually exported tigers — and accuse him of still doing it. “We breed them to get their babies” to sell, Nikhom had recently told Ammann’s investigator, illegal trade an investigative Vietnamese agency has discovered as well. “The Laotian government is ignoring major trafficking across the border,” an agency official said on the condition of anonymity. Then there was something else: Ammann had learned what he believed was the truth of the missing 300 tigers from Sakhone’s farm. Many had been killed, frozen and trafficked, according to Nikhom and interviews I’ve had with two other people with knowledge of the missing tigers. But Ammann could say none of this, not here, not like this.
	 
		Instead, Ammann glanced out into the forests on the other side of the river. They looked so dense. So dark. Surely anything could be out there, even still.
	 
		“What animals are left in this forest?” he asked, waving a hand toward the trees. “Are there any tigers left?”
	 
		Sakhone looked at him for a moment, his face blank.
	 
		“No,” he finally said. “None of those.”
	 
		The tigers weren’t in the forest, but up the hill, on the other side of the resort, moaning all night, a sound that grew louder the next day, as morning gave way to afternoon. Ammann walked along the river and checked his watch: 4 p.m. It would soon be time to feed the tigers. He settled his camera over his shoulder and started up the hill.
	 Ammann went past the gates, the view of the river far below him. He kept his gaze fixed on the ramshackle structure on a bed of gravel — chain-link fencing, anchored by poles and patched with blue tarp. The sound of groaning tigers was all around.
             
 He went inside. Behind two lines of fencing, on either side of the narrow hallway, were flashes of teeth and slate green eyes. Thirty-five tigers, some weighing over 400 pounds, stalked back and forth, back and forth, housed separately in 9-by-12 cages. 
		Every now and then, a worker would pull open a side door connecting the cages, and in would come another tiger. The two would mate then separate, an act that Ammann and I witnessed three times in less than an hour. Standing here, I realized, the existence of the tiger had been reduced to this: endless pacing, speed breeding and an afternoon meal of raw chicken hurled into its cage at 5 p.m.
	 
		“You couldn’t license a zoo like this anywhere in the world,” Ammann said. After spending hours here — during which we saw only one group of local tourists pay the admission fee of $2 — he turned to leave. Then, just outside the front entrance, on the gravel, he saw him.
	 
		Nikhom.
	 Nikhom Keovised. 
		He was sitting at a table strewn with beer bottles — a short man with yellowing teeth, wearing dusty black pants and flip-flops.
	 
		From the front of the enclosure, I watched as Ammann walked over to him.
	 
		How many hours had he listened to the farm manager in the recordings? How many times had he heard him describe the most macabre of details in the most perfunctory of ways? And now here Nikhom was, sitting outside a small concrete house, doing nothing more than drinking and smoking after a day of work.
	 
		Ammann and I took seats at his table. Nikhom smiled at the unexpected guests, pouring us beers. This time, however, Ammann did flip on his camera. Then, as his Lao guide interpreted, and I sat watching, he started in with it:
	 
		“We saw three tiger pairs mating, so in three and a half months, how many babies?”
	 
		“So how often do they get tourists?”
	 
		“What is going to happen to these tigers?”
	 
		Nikhom laughed at the questions, not answering or showing any apparent concern. He offered Ammann more beer. He said he’d worked with tigers since 2007, and this enclosure, which he’d taken over seven months before, was just getting started. These tigers would never leave. Few tourists came, but soon there would be more cages filled with tiger cubs. What he didn’t tell Ammann now, but what he’d told Ammann’s informant: The tigers were profoundly inbred, and few cubs were surviving, only 18 so far.
	 
		“So much work needs to be done?” Ammann said, motioning toward the construction, where more cages were being built. Nikhom only laughed again.
	 
		Ammann took one last look at him. Then he finished his drink, turned off his camera and got up from the table. He’d had enough. He left Nikhom to his beer and his tigers and descended the hill, as the day’s last light bloomed orange and red above the mountains.
	 The sun sets over the tiger “zoo” in Tha Bak. 
		Then it was morning. Ammann directed his driver to take him to the capital to present his findings to the local office of CITES, the regulatory authority of international wildlife trade. He stared out the window, as a landscape of jagged mountains dissolved into an endless expanse of arid plains, and thought of Nikhom. He’d always pictured him as a gangster, powerful and menacing, but he hadn’t been that at all. He’d seemed impoverished, in fact, doing what he had to do to survive, just another bit player in a world unable to save itself.
	 
		“I feel less strongly about him being a miserable human being than some of the conservationists,” he said. At least Nikhom was who he presented himself to be, Ammann realized, and the self-congratulatory networkers at the wildlife conferences — “backslapping orgies,” he liked to call them — were not.
	 
		We stopped at another tiger farm so Ammann could fly the drone over it, and then the city was swelling all around. Soon he was walking inside an expansive building behind thick-trunked trees, carrying a briefcase where he’d stored evidence of his findings. Two new tiger enclosures that didn’t look to him like conservation parks or zoos. Ongoing illegal trade in tiger parts. Signs of expansion at several farms. Allegations that many of the missing 300 tigers had been killed. And proof that the same people who had illegally butchered and sold tigers were still acting as keepers of the animals.
	 Ammann walks in to present his findings. 
		Then he was in a barren conference room, facing a CITES bureaucrat. I sat at the end of the table, watching as the anger Ammann had tried to repress at the resort began to build.
	 
		“We know there are two more tiger farms,” Ammann said. “Two   tiger farms! You said you’re closing them down?” On and on he went — “How can your minister say you’re going to close, if now new ones open up?”— but it was no use.
	 
		Take it up with the bosses in Geneva, he was told. There wasn’t anything the office could do with information brought in like this.
	 
		“This is our system,” the official said.
	 
		Several weeks later, on Jan. 7, Ammann would again write to every major official. He would tell them of the “active speed breeding” in Laos, the “noncompliance” to its own reforms and that, despite the country’s stated intent to save the tiger, “nothing has really changed or is changing.” He would wait for a response that would never come, then quickly move on to planning the next trip, this one to Kunming, China, to investigate elephant trafficking. Meanwhile, he would send me frequent emails, recommend follow-up pieces, plot ways to obtain video of tiger cubs being born at Sakhone’s resort — maybe this would be the final piece of evidence that got people to listen — and gripe about the response CITES sent me concerning wildlife trade in Laos.
	 
		“As with any major change in public policy, it will take time to fully implement and enforce,” the statement said. “While the policy of the Lao government is relatively clear, it is not clear how it is being implemented or enforced.”
	 
		But at this moment, inside a spare conference room, there was only a Laos official telling him, “I cannot respond.” And what was there to say to that? So Ammann took down his email address. He thanked him for his time. He picked up his briefcase with the proof he’d never been asked to show and walked out.
	 
		At the entrance of the building, he stopped for a moment, a strange look on his face. On either side of the doorway was a statue of a tiger. Stripes had been etched into their wooden bodies. Each wore a necklace of fake yellow flowers. Their expressions were frozen in garish snarls. Ammann reached down to touch the head of one of the tigers — an animal once defined by ferocity, now an ornament, lifeless and commodified.
	 
		Then he quickly lifted his hand and walked away.

             Most Read Follow Post Graphics Updated 9:24 PM ET, Tue July 28, 2020  Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Conservationists have captured footage of endangered   in a region of western Thailand for the first time in four years. The largest species of cat in the world, tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They range across Asia from Russia all the way to the Sumatra and Indochina. Researchers still have much to learn about these beautiful, critically endangered, solitary cats.  There is currently one recognized species of tiger,  . Scientists have further classified the tiger into nine subspecies: the extinct Bali, Caspian and Javan subspecies, and the living Malayan, Sumatran, South China, Indochinese, Bengal and Amur (or Siberian) subspecies. Of these six subspecies, AZA-accredited zoos currently manage three: Amur, Malayan and Sumatran. The Smithsonian's National Zoo is home to Sumatran and Amur tigers. Tigers have reddish-orange coats with prominent black stripes, white bellies and white spots on their ears. Like a human fingerprint, no two tigers have the exact same markings. Because of this, researchers can use stripe patterns to identify different individuals when studying tigers in the wild. Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They are the largest terrestrial mammal whose diet consists entirely of meat. The tiger's closest relative is the lion. In fact, without fur, it is difficult to distinguish a tiger from a lion. Historically, tigers existed throughout much of Eastern and Southern Asia, as well as in parts of Central and Western Asia and the Middle East, surrounding the Caspian Sea. Their range has diminished significantly as human populations have expanded. It is believed they currently occupy just 7 percent of their historic range. Presently, tigers are found in a variety of habitats across South and Southeast Asia, China and Eastern Russia. They thrive in temperate, tropical or evergreen forests, mangrove swamps and grasslands. Amur tigers are primarily found in Far-East Russia, although there are small populations across the border into China and potentially North Korea. Sumatran tigers are found only on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. A tiger's range within these regions is determined by the availability of prey. Despite their solitary nature, communication is a very important part of tigers' behavioral ecology. They communicate through vocalizations, such as roaring, grunting and chuffing, and through signals, such as scent marking and scratches on trees. Tigers are fiercely territorial animals, so these signals are particularly important to communicating where one tiger's home range ends and another's begins. Tigers are solitary ambush predators that rely on stealth and strength to take down prey. These apex predators primarily hunt large ungulates, such as wild boar and deer, but are also known to consume monkeys, buffalo, sloth bears, leopards and even crocodiles. When tigers are found in close proximity to humans, they may also feed on domestic animals, such as cattle or goats. Tigers are adept swimmers and have even been recorded hunting in the wild. These powerful cats hunt primarily at night, using sight and sound to identify prey. Their striped coats help them blend into their surroundings, where they lie in wait for prey to pass by. At the opportune moment, tigers pounce on their prey, take it to the ground and finish the kill by breaking or biting the neck. Tigers hunt about once a week and consume as much as 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of food in one night. At the Zoo, tigers eat ground beef, and their diet is supplemented with enrichment items each week. They receive knucklebones or cow femurs twice a week and rabbits once a week to exercise their jaws and keep their teeth healthy. Tigers are solitary creatures, except when mating or raising young. Cubs stay with their mothers until they learn to hunt successfully, usually at about 18 to 24 months old. They reach full independence after two to three years, at which point they disperse to find their own territory. Female tigers often remain near their mother's' territory, while males disperse farther from home. Female tigers reach sexual maturity between age 3 and 4. Males are sexually mature at about 4 or 5 years old. Mating can occur at any time of year but most often takes place during cooler months between November and April. Tigers are induced ovulators, which means females will not release eggs until mating occurs. Gestation lasts approximately 100 days, and females give birth to between one and seven offspring at a time, averaging between two and four cubs. Once cubs become independent, at about age 2, females are ready to give birth again. However, if a female's offspring do not survive, due to causes such as infanticide or starvation, she is able to conceive another litter right away. The life span of tigers in the wild is usually between 10 and 15 years. In human care, or on rare occasions in the wild, a tiger can live up to 20 years. However, approximately half of all wild tiger cubs do not survive past the first two years of life. Only 40 percent of those that reach independence actually live to establish a territory and produce young. The risk of mortality remains high for adult tigers due to their territorial nature, which often results in direct competition with conspecifics, or members of the same species. Globally, tigers are considered an endangered species. Only six of the nine tiger subspecies that once existed remain, and the South China tiger is thought to be nearly or entirely extinct in the wild. The Sumatran subspecies is listed as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, and the Amur is listed as endangered. All tigers are protected under CITES Appendix I. It is generously estimated that only 3,900 tigers exist in the wild, including approximately 200 to 400 Sumatran tigers and 360 Amur tigers. The Smithsonian's National Zoo participates in the Species Survival Plan for Sumatran and Amur tigers, which works to responsibly breed and manage tiger populations within AZA-accredited institutions throughout North America. The goal of the SSP is to sustain a population of the three manage tiger subspecies—Amur, Sumatran and Malayan—that is genetically healthy enough to maintain a high genetic diversity for the next 100 years. There are numerous threats to tiger survival, including human-animal conflict driven by human overpopulation, poaching for use in traditional medicines and the destruction and fragmentation of habitat. Human-animal conflict stems from two primary issues. The first is a rise in agriculture and overgrazing by farmers, which drives away typical prey for tigers and forces them to hunt livestock. The second is urban sprawl and the encroachment of towns and cities into tiger territories, which displaces the cats and leads to killing by humans provoked by fear. These conflicts are not unique to Asia and are common as humans encroach upon the territory of large predators around the world. In the U.S., cougars in the western parts of the country have faced similar threats. The demand for tiger bones and other body parts used in traditional Asian medicines is also contributing to the tiger's decline. Despite the work of many governments and scientists to decrease demand by educating the public about other sources for these "medical" compounds, an illegal market for tiger parts persists. In some areas, tiger farming has become a profitable illicit market. For decades, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute scientists have studied tigers to understand their behavioral ecology and the most effective ways to protect them. They support efforts to stop poaching and trafficking, reduce human-tiger conflict, improve management practices in tiger habitats and protect Asian forests where tigers live. In collaboration with USAID and local partners in Bangladesh, SCBI scientists are collecting and analyzing a wide range of field data on tigers, prey and mangrove habitat, including through camera-trap studies to estimate tiger populations. To support and assist management of this project, rangers are trained and given equipment to patrol the forest to prevent poaching and mitigate human-animal conflict. Smithsonian efforts to save tigers began in 1972 with the Smithsonian-Nepal Tiger Ecology Project. In the 1990s scientists began approaching tiger conservation as a complex problem stretching across borders, requiring the cooperation of many partners. In 2008, the Smithsonian Institution joined the World Bank Group and the Global Environmental Facility to launch the Global Tiger Initiative, designed to stabilize and restore wild tiger populations to save the species from extinction. As a member of the GTI, SCBI scientists work with policy makers and practitioners across Asia and around the world to save tigers. At the Tiger Summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2010, leaders of 13 tiger-range countries met with international science and conservation experts, including SCBI scientists, to do what had never been done before: create a comprehensive strategy to save tigers. At the Summit, they adopted the first-of-its-kind Global Tiger Recovery Program (GTRP). Simultaneously, SCBI staff worked with individual countries to develop National Tiger Recovery Priorities. .p As part of the GTRP, the Smithsonian prepared a Global Support Program in Capacity Building and Knowledge Sharing through regional training programs in Asia and Core Learning Programs on conservation best practices. They have held courses and workshops for frontline practitioners in protected tiger-range areas, training hundreds of rangers, foresters and habitat managers to adopt the latest conservation and Spatial Monitoring and Report Tool (SMART) patrolling practices, with a focus on preserving and increasing wild tiger populations. SMART patrol training courses have been held in Thailand, Nepal, Indonesia and Malaysia. Using state-of-the-art techniques, the training has helped create more effective measures against wildlife poaching and the illegal trade and trafficking of live tigers and tiger parts. Today, follow up projects like SCBI’s Tiger Conservation Partnership Program help Malaysia share information with its neighbors about effective ways to identify and protect tiger habitats in the face of rapid infrastructure development. Its knowledge exchange platform, WildTigers Listserv, has more than 500 tiger conservation professionals as members. There is still much to be done to protect tigers from going extinct. Their future relies heavily on the protection of habitat within their range, which overlaps with areas of significant and continued human population growth. Continued partnerships between governments, conservation organizations and communities will be essential to the long-term protection of this species. The Smithsonian's National Zoo has two Amur tigers, a male named Pavel and a female named Nikita, and one Sumatran tiger, a female named Damai. Damai gave birth to a male Sumatran tiger cub on July 11, 2017. The cub was later  , where he currently lives and thrives with another young male tiger cub. Nikita came to the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in 2019 from the Bronx Zoo in New York as part of a breeding recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ Species Survival Plan. Pavel arrived at the Zoo in 2017 from the Lincoln Park Zoo in Illinois.  General Info |  Smithsonian’s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute 3001 Connecticut Ave., NW Washington, DC 20008 PO Box 37012 We   need your support.

With Tiger King shedding light on how big cats can be forced into cruel, unnatural living situations when held in captivity, you can see why it's more important than ever to protect all big cats in the wild and to preserve and restore habitat for these amazing creatures. Defenders of Wildlife protects big cats in North America, like Florida panthers and jaguars, and we tirelessly advocate for human-wildlife coexistence, which should never include making wild animals pets.  The largest of the big cats, tigers are truly impressive animals with their black-striped orange fur and white bellies. A tiger’s stripe pattern is like a fingerprint and can be used to identify individuals. The tiger is the largest member of the felid (cat) family. Tiger taxonomy was revised in 2017 based on new genetic analysis into two subspecies:  , consisting of tiger populations in continental Asia, and  , including populations in the Sunda Islands. Since tigers are not native to North America, Defenders does not work on their conservation directly. Defenders works to ensure that tigers remain protected under the Endangered Species Act, and under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) highlighting their link to jaguar trade. Many of the threats facing   and   in North America, such as habitat loss, road kills and poaching, are also experienced by tigers. Because of this, we work closely with tiger conservationists to better enable human-wildlife coexistence by exchanging innovative and effective tools and technology for protecting livestock and people.  Your adoption supports our work to ensure that tigers remain protected under the Endangered Species Act, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and other international laws and treaties. 
 Tigers face many threats. Their greatest threat is large scale loss of habitat and prey due to human encroachment and habitat degradation for agriculture. Climate change is also causing ocean levels to rise, reducing coastal habitat in areas like India’s Sunderban islands and forcing tigers to move into areas more heavily populated by people. In some parts of their range, tigers are poached because their pelts are valuable in the black market trade in Asia and their other body parts are used in traditional Asian medicine. Tigers are also killed or removed from the wild in efforts to protect livestock and human communities. Finally, as tigers recover in some regions, they come into contact more often with people, pets and livestock, which can increase human-wildlife conflicts if tigers and people are not proactively managed. You can help tigers through being a conscious shopping. Palm oil plantations are replacing tiger habitat in Southeast Asia, so read food ingredient labels to check if the palm oil in your product is sustainably grown. When traveling abroad, do not purchase souvenirs or gifts that may contain tiger products – even products made from ‘tiger substitutes’ can contribute to declines in other endangered species, so it is best to avoid wildlife products entirely. Finally, become big cat savvy by learning about imperiled big cats in North America like the   and  .  Tigers live in 13 range countries across Asia. Tigers occupy a variety of habitats from tropical forests, evergreen forests, woodlands and mangrove swamps to grasslands, savannah and rocky country. In the early 1900s, there were estimated to be around 100,000 tigers throughout their range. Today, around 4,000 tigers live in the wild, while roughly 5,000-7,000 exist in captivity. Tigers are mostly nocturnal (more active at night) and are ambush predators that rely on the camouflage their stripes provide to stalk prey. Tigers use their body weight to knock prey to the ground and kill with a bite to the neck. They are also very good swimmers and have been known to drown their prey. Tigers are territorial and typically live solitary lives, except during mating season and while females raise young. Mating Season: In tropical climates, mostly from around November to April; during the winter months in temperate regions. 
Gestation: 103-105 days. 
Litter size: 3-4 cubs. 
Cubs follow their mother out of the den at around 8 weeks and become independent at around 18 months of age. They leave their mothers at about 2 ½ years. Mothers guard their young from wandering males that may kill the cubs to make the female receptive to mating. Tigers mainly eat sambar deer, wild pigs, water buffalo and antelope. Old and injured tigers have been known to attack domestic cattle and people. 1130 17th Street NW

	A tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the new coronavirus, in what is believed to be the first known infection in an animal in the U.S. or a tiger anywhere, federal officials and the zoo said Sunday. 
	The 4-year-old Malayan tiger named Nadia -- and six other tigers and lions that have also fallen ill -- are believed to have been infected by a zoo employee who wasn't yet showing symptoms, the zoo said. The first animal started showing symptoms March 27, and all are doing well and expected to recover, said the zoo, which has been closed to the public since March 16 amid the surging coronavirus outbreak in New York. 
	The test result stunned zoo officials: "I couldn't believe it," director Jim Breheny said. But he hopes the finding can contribute to the global fight against the virus that causes COVID-19. 
	"Any kind of knowledge that we get on how it's transmitted, how different species react to it, that knowledge somehow is going to provide a greater base resource for people," he said in an interview. 
	The finding raises new questions about transmission of the virus in animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which confirmed Nadia's test result at its veterinary lab, said there are no known cases of the virus in U.S. pets or livestock. 
	"There doesn't appear to be, at this time, any evidence that suggests that the animals can spread the virus to people or that they can be a source of the infection in the United States," Dr. Jane Rooney, a veterinarian and a USDA official, said in an interview. 
	The USDA said Sunday it's not recommending routine coronavirus testing of animals, in zoos or elsewhere, or of zoo employees. Still, Rooney said a small number of animals in the U.S. have been tested through the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories, and all those tests came back negative except Nadia's. 
	The coronavirus outbreaks around the world are driven by person-to-person transmission, experts say. 
	There have been a handful of reports outside the U.S. of pet dogs or cats becoming infected after close contact with contagious people, including a Hong Kong dog that tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. Hong Kong agriculture authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn't pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners. 
	Some researchers have been trying to understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the virus, and to determine how it spreads among animals, according to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health. 
	The American Veterinary Medical Association and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been recommending that out of an abundance of caution, people ill with the coronavirus should limit contact with animals -- advice that the veterinary group reiterated after learning of the tiger's test result. 
	In general, the CDC also advises people to wash their hands after handling animals and do other things to keep pets and their homes clean. 
	At the Bronx Zoo, Nadia, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions developed dry coughs, and some of the cats exhibited some wheezing and loss of appetite, said Dr. Paul Calle, the zoo's chief veterinarian. 
	The staff figured there could be a relatively routine explanation for the cats' symptoms but tested Nadia for coronavirus out of "due diligence and an abundance of caution," Breheny said. Only Nadia was tested because it takes anesthesia to get a sample from a big cat, and she had already been knocked out to be examined. 
	Calle said the test was different from the one used for people and was carried out by a veterinary school laboratory, not one that handles human samples. 
	"There is no competition for testing between these two very different situations," he said. 
	The seven sickened cats live in two areas at the zoo, and the animals had contact with the same worker, who is doing OK, zoo officials said. They said there are no signs of illness in other big cats on the property. 
	Staffers who work with the cats will now wear infection-protection garb, as primate keepers have done for years because of the animals' closer genetic ties to human beings, Breheny said. 
	For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as a fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and can be fatal.

 Pigs, deer, rhinoceroses, and even small elephants. Tigers live in many habitats, including tropical rain forest, snow-covered coniferous and deciduous forests, mangrove swamps, and drier forest areas. Recognizing a tiger at the zoo is easy. But in their natural habitat in scattered, small areas in Asia, tigers are really hard to find. That’s because their unique orange, black, and white stripe pattern helps them blend into the forests and grassy areas where they live and hunt. Tigers are carnivores.   They are quiet, patient hunters with large powerful paws and teeth to help them catch and eat their prey. Some of their favorite meals include pigs, deer, rhinoceroses, and even small elephants. Tigers hunt for their food, but they are also hunted by humans for their valuable fur and body parts. Because of this, tiger researches think there may only be 3,500 tigers left in the world. This makes them an endangered species. Like human fingerprints, every tiger has a unique pattern of stripes that can be used to identify it!  A tiger's canine teeth are 3 inches long. A tiger’s night vision is 6 times better than a human’s.

Staff rushed to her aid and eventually managed to draw the tiger out of the cage, but the 55-year-old keeper died at the scene, Zurich zoo said. Visitors raised the alarm at about 13:20 (11:20 GMT) on Saturday.  An investigation is under way to determine why the zookeeper was in the cage at the same time as the tiger. Despite an emergency team at the zoo luring the tiger from the enclosure and into a holding pen, efforts to resuscitate the wounded keeper failed, the zoo said in a statement.  "Sadly all help came too late," a spokeswoman for Zurich police, Judith Hoedl, said.  The tiger, named Irina, was born at a zoo in Denmark in 2015 and transferred to Zurich last year. The director of Zurich zoo, Severin Dressen, said the zookeeper had been a member of staff there for some time, the AP news agency reported.  "Our full sympathy is with the relatives of the victim," Mr Dressen added.  Professional counselling has been made available for those who witnessed the attack.  Zurich zoo said it would remain closed on Sunday following the incident.  Animal attacks at zoos and sanctuaries are relatively rare, but this is not the first reported attack at Zurich zoo.  In December 2019, a crocodile at the zoo bit the hand of a keeper during a routine cleaning operation in the animal's enclosure. When the reptile failed to release its grip on the keeper, the decision was made to shoot it.  The president said the drug is only rejected as a Covid-19 treatment because he suggested it. 15 sayings from around the world

It is an  , primarily preying on   such as   and  . It is territorial and generally a   predator, requiring large contiguous areas of  , which support its requirements for   and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's   to establish their own.
 The tiger once ranged widely from the   in the west to the   basin, and in the south from the foothills of the   to   in the  . Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in   and  , from the islands of   and Bali, and in large areas of   and   and  . Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from     to subtropical and   on the   and  . 
 The tiger is listed as   on the  . As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline include  ,   and  . This, coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more   on  , has caused significant  .
 The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's  . It featured prominently in ancient   and   and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many  ,   and as   for sporting teams. The tiger is the   of  ,  ,   and  .
 The     and     derive from Old French  , from    . 
This was a borrowing of   τίγρις 'tigris', a foreign borrowing of unknown origin meaning 'tiger' as well as the river  . 
The origin may have been the   word   meaning 'pointed or sharp', and the   word   'arrow', perhaps referring to the speed of the tiger's leap, although these words are not known to have any meanings associated with tigers. 
 The generic name   is derived from the   word  , and the   word πάνθηρ 'panther'. 
The   word पाण्डर pāṇḍ-ara means 'pale yellow, whitish, white'. 
 In 1758,   described the tiger in his work   and gave it the    .  In 1929, the British taxonomist   subordinated the species under the genus   using the scientific name  . 
 Following Linnaeus's first descriptions of the species, several tiger   were described and proposed as  .  The   of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999. Most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence characteristics that vary widely within populations.  , tigers from different regions vary little, and   between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the  . Therefore, it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely   in mainland Asia, and   in the  . 
 Results of   analysis of 111 tiger skulls from Southeast Asian range countries indicate that Sumatran tiger skulls differ from Indochinese and Javan tiger skulls, whereas Bali tiger skulls are similar in size to Javan tiger skulls. The authors proposed to classify Sumatran and Javan tiger as distinct species,   and   with Bali tiger as subspecies  . 
 In 2015, morphological, ecological and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction of the two evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely   comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and   comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management. The     constitutes two  : 
 One conservation specialist welcomed this proposal as it would make captive breeding programmes and future rewilding of zoo-born tigers easier. One   was sceptical of this study and maintained that the currently recognised nine subspecies can be distinguished genetically. 
 In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the   revised felid taxonomy and recognized the tiger populations in continental Asia as  , and those in the Sunda Islands as  . 
The following tables are based on the   of the species   provided in  .  It also reflects the classification used by the Cat Classification Task Force in 2017:
 A study published in 2018 was based on 32 tiger specimens using the   approach for analysis. Results support six   tiger   corresponding with the living subspecies and indicate that the most recent   lived about 110,000 years ago. 
 The tiger's closest living relatives were previously thought to be the   species  ,   and  . Results of   indicate that about 2.88 million years ago, the tiger and the     diverged from the other   species, and that both may be more closely related to each other than to the lion, leopard and jaguar. 
The geographic origin of the   is most likely northern Central Asia or the   region. The tiger–snow leopard lineage dispersed in Southeast Asia during the  . 
  is considered to be a   of the modern tiger. It lived at the beginning of the   about two million years ago, its   remains were   in   of northwestern China. It was smaller and more " ", but functionally and ecologically similar to the modern tiger. It is disputed as to whether it had the striping pattern. Northwestern China is thought to be the origin of the tiger lineage. Tigers grew in size, possibly in response to   of prey species like   and  , which may have occurred in Southeast Asia during the  .

Tigers reached India and northern Asia in the late Pleistocene, reaching eastern  ,  , and  . Some fossil skulls are morphologically distinct from lion skulls, which could indicate tiger presence in Alaska during the  , about 100,000 years ago. 
 In the    , two articulated   were found amidst an assemblage of other animal bones and stone tools in   near the village of New Ibajay. They were smaller than mainland tiger fossils, possibly due to  . Otherwise, it would appear that early humans had accumulated the bones,  so it may be that the tiger parts were imported from elsewhere, or that the tiger colonised Palawan from Borneo before the Holocene, considering the proximity of the two islands.  Fossil remains of tigers were also excavated in Sri Lanka, China,   and   (Malaysia) dating to the late  ,   and Early  .  The   was apparently present in Borneo between the   and the Holocene, but whether it went extinct in prehistoric or recent times has not been resolved. 
 The potential tiger range during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene was predicted applying   based on more than 500 tiger locality records combined with   data. The resulting model shows a contiguous tiger range from southern India to Siberia at the  , indicating an unobstructed   between tiger populations in mainland Asia throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The tiger populations on the Sunda Islands and mainland Asia were possibly separated during  .  Results of a   study indicate that all living tigers had a common ancestor 72,000–108,000 years ago.  The tiger's full   sequence was published in 2013. It was found to have similar repeat composition to other cat genomes and an appreciably conserved  . 
 Captive tigers were bred with lions to create   called liger and tigon. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species. Breeding hybrids is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conservation. 
The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress. Ligers are typically between 10 and 12 ft (3.0 and 3.7 m) in length, and weigh between 800 and 1,000 lb (360 and 450 kg) or more.  Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species. 
 The less common tigon is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger.  Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene, tigons are around the same size as their parents.  Some females are fertile and have occasionally given birth to   when mated to a male  . 
 The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of its body. Its   is dense and heavy, and   varies between shades of orange and brown with white   areas and distinctive vertical black stripes that are unique in each individual.  Stripes are likely advantageous for   in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade.  The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns and   are the more common camouflage pattern among felids.  The orangish colour may also aid in camouflage as the tiger's prey are  , and thus may perceive the cat as green and blended in with the vegetation.  A tiger's coat pattern is still visible when it is  . This is not due to skin pigmentation, but to the stubble and   embedded in the skin, similar to human beards (colloquially  ), and is in common with other big cats.  They have a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. The   are circular with yellow  . The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black.  These spots are thought to play an important role in   communication. 
 The tiger's   is similar to a  's skull, with the frontal region usually less depressed or flattened, and a slightly longer   region. The lion skull shows broader   openings. Due to the variation in skull sizes of the two species, the structure of the lower jaw is a reliable indicator for their identification.  The tiger has fairly stout teeth; its somewhat curved   are the longest among living felids with a   height of up to 90 mm (3.5 in). 
 There is a notable   between male and female tigers, with the latter being consistently smaller. The size difference between them is proportionally greater in the large tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females. Males also have wider forepaw pads, enabling sex to be identified from tracks.  It has been   that body size of different tiger populations may be correlated with climate and be explained by   and  , or by distribution and size of available prey species. 
 Generally, males vary in total length from 250 to 390 cm (8.2 to 12.8 ft) and weigh between 90 and 300 kg (200 and 660 lb) with skull length ranging from 316 to 383 mm (12.4 to 15.1 in). Females vary in total length from 200 to 275 cm (6.56 to 9.02 ft), weigh 65 to 167 kg (143 to 368 lb) with skull length ranging from 268 to 318 mm (0.879 to 1.043 ft). In either sex, the tail represents about 0.6 to 1.1 m (24 to 43 in) of the total length. The Bengal and Siberian tigers are amongst the tallest cats in shoulder height. They are also ranked among the biggest cats that have ever existed reaching weights of more than 300 kg (660 lb).  The tigers of the Sunda islands are smaller and less heavy than tigers in mainland Asia, rarely exceeding 142 kg (313 lb) in weight. 
 There are three colour variants — white, golden and stripeless snow white — that now rarely occur in the wild due to the reduction of wild tiger populations, but continue in captive populations. The   has white fur and sepia brown stripes. The   has a pale golden pelage with a blond tone and reddish-brown stripes. The snow white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale reddish-brown ringed tail.  Both snow white and golden tigers are homozygous for    .  A   is a colour variant due to pseudo- . They have thick stripes close together so that the background colour is barely visible between stripes. 
 The white tiger lacks   (which creates the orange colour), and has dark sepia-brown stripes and blue eyes. This altered pigmentation is caused by a   gene that is inherited as an   trait, which is determined by a white  . It is not an  , as the   are scarcely affected.  The mutation changes a single   in the transporter protein  . Both parents need to have the   for whiteness to have white cubs. 
Between the early and mid 20th century, white tigers were recorded and shot in the Indian states of  ,  ,   and in the area of  . The local maharaja started breeding tigers in the early 1950s and kept a white male tiger together with its normal-coloured daughter; they had white cubs. 
To preserve this recessive trait, only a few white individuals were used in captive breeding, which led to a high degree of  .   is the main reason for many health problems of captive white tigers, including  ,  ,   and premature death. 
Other physical defects include   and  . 
 The Tiger   has condemned the breeding of white tigers, alleging they are of mixed ancestry and of unknown lineage. The   responsible for white colouration are represented by 0.001% of the population. The disproportionate growth in numbers of white tigers points to   among     individuals. This would lead to   and loss of  . 
 The tiger historically ranged from eastern   and   to the coast of the  , and from   across   to the Indonesian islands of  ,   and  .  Since the end of the  , it was probably restricted by periods of deep snow lasting longer than six months.  Currently, it occurs in less than 6% of its historical range, as it has been extirpated from   and  , large parts of Southeast and  . It now mainly occurs in the  , the  , Sumatra and the  . In China and Myanmar, breeding populations appear to rely on immigration from neighbouring countries while its status in the   is unknown. 
 The tiger is essentially associated with   habitats.  Tiger populations thrive where populations of wild  ,   and suids are stable. 
Records in Central Asia indicate that it occurred foremost in   riverine forests along the  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   and their tributaries. In the Caucasus, it inhabited hilly and lowland forests. 
Historical records in   are known only from the southern coast of the   and adjacent  .  In the  -  region, it inhabits   and  , where   provide food and water, and serve as dispersal corridors for both tiger and ungulates. 
On the Indian subcontinent, it inhabits mainly  , moist  ,   and the   of the  .  In the  , tigers were documented in   up to an elevation of 3,630 m (11,910 ft).  In Thailand, it lives in deciduous and evergreen forests.  In Laos, 14 tigers were documented in semi-evergreen and evergreen forest interspersed with grassland in   National Protected Area during surveys from 2013 to 2017.  In Sumatra, tiger populations range from lowland   to rugged montane forests. 
 When not subject to human disturbance, the tiger is mainly  .  It does not often climb trees but cases have been recorded.  It is a strong swimmer and often bathes in ponds, lakes and rivers, thus keeping cool in the heat of the day.  Individuals can cross rivers up to 7 km (4.3 mi) wide and can swim up to 29 km (18 mi) in a day.  During the 1980s, a tiger was observed frequently hunting prey through deep lake water in  . 
 The tiger is a long-ranging species, and individuals disperse over distances of up to 650 km (400 mi) to reach tiger populations in other areas.    tigers in   started   from their natal areas earliest at the age of 19 months. Four females dispersed between 0 and 43.2 km (0.0 and 26.8 mi), and 10 males between 9.5 and 65.7 km (5.9 and 40.8 mi). None of them crossed open cultivated areas that were more than 10 km (6.2 mi) wide, but moved through forested habitat. 
 Adult tigers lead largely solitary lives. They establish and maintain   but have much wider home ranges within which they roam. Resident adults of either sex generally confine their movements to their home ranges, within which they satisfy their needs and those of their growing cubs. Individuals sharing the same area are aware of each other's movements and activities.  The size of the home range mainly depends on prey abundance, geographic area and sex of the individual.  In India, home ranges appear to be 50 to 1,000 km  (19 to 386 sq mi) while in Manchuria, they range from 500 to 4,000 km  (190 to 1,540 sq mi). In Nepal, defended territories are recorded to be 19 to 151 km  (7.3 to 58.3 sq mi) for males and 10 to 51 km  (3.9 to 19.7 sq mi) for females. 
 Young female tigers establish their first territories close to their mother's. The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time. Males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out at a younger age to  . A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers. 
 To identify his territory, the male marks trees by   and   secretions, as well as marking trails with   and marking trees or the ground with their claws. Females also use these "scrapes", as well as urine and scat markings. Scent markings of this type allow an individual to pick up information on another's identity, sex and reproductive status. Females in   will signal their availability by scent marking more frequently and increasing their vocalisations. 
 Although for the most part avoiding each other, tigers are not always territorial and relationships between individuals can be complex. An adult of either sex will sometimes share its kill with others, even those who may not be related to them.   observed a male share a kill with two females and four cubs. Unlike male lions, male tigers allow females and cubs to feed on the kill before the male is finished with it; all involved generally seem to behave amicably, in contrast to the competitive behaviour shown by a lion pride.  Stephen Mills described a social feeding event in Ranthambhore National Park:
 A   tigress they called Padmini killed a 250 kg (550 lb) male   – a very large antelope. They found her at the kill just after dawn with her three 14-month-old cubs, and they watched uninterrupted for the next ten hours. During this period the family was joined by two adult females and one adult male, all offspring from Padmini's previous litters, and by two unrelated tigers, one female the other unidentified. By three o'clock there were no fewer than nine tigers round the kill. Occasionally, male tigers participate in raising cubs, usually their own, but this is extremely rare and not always well understood. In May 2015, Amur tigers were photographed by camera traps in the Sikhote-Alin Bioshpere Reserve. The photos show a male Amur tiger pass by, followed by a female and three cubs within the span of about two minutes. 
In Ranthambore, a male Bengal tiger raised and defended two orphaned female cubs after their mother had died of illness. The cubs remained under his care, he supplied them with food, protected them from his rival and sister, and apparently also trained them. 
 Male tigers are generally more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture.  Once   has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, as long as they do not live in too close quarters.  The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and sometimes resulted in the death of one of the males. 
 Facial expressions include the "defense threat", where an individual bares its teeth, flattens its ears and its pupils enlarge. Both males and females show a  , a characteristic grimace, when sniffing urine markings, but flehmen is more often associated with males detecting the markings made by tigresses in oestrus. Like other  , tigers  , particularly in aggressive situations, during the mating season or when making a kill. There are two different roars: the "true" roar is made using the   and forced through an open mouth as it progressively closes, and the shorter, harsher "coughing" roar is made with the mouth open and teeth exposed. The "true" roar can be heard at up to 3 km (1.9 mi) away and is sometimes emitted three or four times in succession. When tense, tigers will moan, a sound similar to a roar but more subdued and made when the mouth is partially or completely closed. Moaning can be heard 400 m (1,300 ft) away.   —soft, low-frequency snorting similar to   in smaller cats—is heard in more friendly situations.  Other vocal communications include grunts, woofs, snarls, miaows, hisses and growls. 
 In the wild, tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized mammals, particularly   weighing 60–250 kg (130–550 lb). Range-wide,  ,  ,   and   are significantly preferred. Tigers are capable of taking down larger prey like adult   but will also opportunistically eat much smaller prey, such as  ,   and other ground-based  ,  ,  , and  .  They also prey on other predators, including dogs, leopards, pythons, bears, and crocodiles.  Tigers generally do not prey on fully grown adult   and   but incidents have been reported.  More often, it is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken.  When in close proximity to humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as  ,  , and  . Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for   such as fruit of the  . 
 Tigers are thought to be mainly   predators,  but in areas where humans are absent, remote-controlled, hidden   recorded them hunting in daylight.  They generally hunt alone and ambush their prey as most other cats do, overpowering them from any angle, using their body size and strength to knock the prey off balance. Successful hunts usually require the tiger to almost simultaneously leap onto its quarry, knock it over, and grab the throat or nape with its teeth.  Despite their large size, tigers can reach speeds of about 49–65 km/h (30–40 mph) but only in short bursts; consequently, tigers must be close to their prey before they break cover. If the prey catches wind of the tiger's presence before this, the tiger usually abandons the hunt rather than chase prey or battle it head-on. Horizontal leaps of up to 10 m (33 ft) have been reported, although leaps of around half this distance are more typical. One in 2 to 20 hunts, including stalking near potential prey, ends in a successful kill. 
 When hunting larger animals, tigers prefer to bite the throat and use their powerful forelimbs to hold onto the prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of  .  By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much.  Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species.  Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on its own. 
 With smaller prey, such as monkeys and hares, the tiger bites the  , often breaking the  , piercing the  , or severing the   or  .  Though rarely observed, some tigers have been recorded to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle,  and break the backs of  . 
 After killing their prey, tigers sometimes drag it to conceal it in vegetative cover, usually pulling it by grasping with their mouths at the site of the killing bite. This, too, can require great physical strength. In one case, after it had killed an adult gaur, a tiger was observed to drag the massive carcass over a distance of 12 m (39 ft). When 13 men simultaneously tried to drag the same carcass later, they were unable to move it.  An adult tiger can go for up to two weeks without eating, then gorge on 34 kg (75 lb) of flesh at one time. In captivity, adult tigers are fed 3 to 6 kg (6.6 to 13.2 lb) of meat a day. 
 Tigers usually prefer to eat prey they have caught themselves, but may eat carrion in times of scarcity and may even   prey from other large carnivores. Although predators typically avoid one another, if a prey item is under dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common. If these are not sufficient, the conflicts may turn violent; tigers may kill competitors as  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and   on occasion. Tigers may also prey on these competitors.  Attacks on smaller predators, such as  ,  , and  , are almost certainly predatory.  Crocodiles, bears, and large packs of dholes may win conflicts against tigers and, in the cases of crocodiles and bears, even can kill them. 
 The considerably smaller   avoids competition from tigers by hunting at different times of the day and hunting different prey.  In India's  , most prey selected by leopards were from 30 to 175 kg (66 to 386 lb) against a preference for prey weighing over 176 kg (388 lb) in the tigers. The average prey weight in the two respective big cats in India was 37.6 kg (83 lb) against 91.5 kg (202 lb).  With relatively abundant prey, tigers and leopards were seen to successfully coexist without competitive exclusion or interspecies   hierarchies that may be more common to the   savanna, where the leopard exists with the lion.    may feed on the tiger's kills.  Tigers appear to inhabit the deep parts of a forest while smaller predators like leopards and dholes are pushed closer to the fringes. 
 The tiger   all year round, but most cubs are born between March and June, with a second peak in September.   ranges from 93 to 114 days, with an average of 103 to 105 days. A female is only receptive for three to six days.  Mating is frequent and noisy during that time.  The female gives birth in a sheltered location such as in tall grass, in a dense thicket, cave or rocky crevice. The father generally takes no part in rearing.  Litters consist of two or three cubs, rarely as many as six. Cubs weigh from 780 to 1,600 g (1.72 to 3.53 lb) each at birth, and are born with eyes closed. They open their eyes when they are six to 14 days old.  Their   break through at the age of about two weeks. They start to eat meat at the age of eight weeks. At around this time, females usually shift them to a new den.  They make short ventures with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older.  Females lactate for five to six months.  Around the time they are weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and are taught how to hunt. 
 A   cub emerges in most litters, usually a male. The dominant cub is more active than its siblings and takes the lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier.  The cubs start hunting on their own earliest at the age of 11 months, and become independent around 18 to 20 months of age.  They separate from their mother at the age of two to two and a half years, but continue to grow until the age of five years.  Young females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males at four to five years.  Unrelated wandering male tigers often kill cubs to make the female receptive, since the tigress may give birth to another litter within five months if the cubs of the previous litter are lost. The mortality rate of tiger cubs is about 50% in the first two years. Few other predators attack tiger cubs due to the diligence and ferocity of the mother. Apart from humans and other tigers, common causes of cub mortality are starvation, freezing, and accidents.    of the tiger is about eight years. 
The oldest recorded captive tiger lived for 26 years.

 In the 1990s, a new approach to tiger conservation was developed: Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), which are blocks of habitat that have the potential to host tiger populations in 15 habitat types within five  . Altogether 143 TCUs were identified and prioritized based on size and integrity of habitat, poaching pressure and population status. They range in size from 33 to 155,829 km  (13 to 60,166 sq mi). 
 In 2016, an estimate of a global wild tiger population of approximately 3,890 individuals was presented during the Third Asia Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation.  The   subsequently declared that the world's count of wild tigers had risen for the first time in a century. 
 Major threats to the tiger include  ,   and   for fur and body parts, which have simultaneously greatly reduced tiger populations in the wild.  In India, only 11% of the historical tiger habitat remains due to habitat fragmentation.  Demand for tiger parts for use in   has also been cited as a major threat to tiger populations.  Some estimates suggest that there are fewer than 2,500 mature breeding individuals, with no subpopulation containing more than 250 mature breeding individuals.  The global wild tiger population was estimated by the   at 3,200 in 2011 and 3,890 in 2015—  reported that this was the first increase in a century. 
 India is home to the world's largest population of wild tigers.  A 2014 census estimated a population of 2,226, a 30% increase since 2011.  On   2019, the 'Tiger Estimation Report 2018’ was released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The report estimates a population of 2967 tigers in India with 25% increase since 2014. Modi said "India is one of the safest habitats for tigers as it has achieved the target of doubling the tiger population from 1411 in 2011 to 2967 in 2019". 
 In 1973, India's  , started by  , established numerous tiger reserves. The project was credited with tripling the number of wild Bengal tigers from some 1,200 in 1973 to over 3,500 in the 1990s, but a 2007 census showed that numbers had dropped back to about 1,400 tigers because of poaching.  Following the report, the Indian government pledged $153 million to the initiative, set up measures to combat poaching, promised funds to relocate up to 200,000 villagers in order to reduce human-tiger interactions,  and set up eight new  .  India also reintroduced tigers to the   and by 2009 it was claimed that poaching had been effectively countered at  . 
 In the 1940s, the Siberian tiger was on the brink of extinction with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in Russia. As a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the   and a network of protected zones ( ) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred. Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the   collapsed. The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450 km  needed by a single female and more for a single male).  Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and  's in concert with international organisations, such as the   and the  .  The competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters to tolerate the big cats. Tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers.  In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little  .  However, in a decade later, the Siberian tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals. 
 In China, tigers became the target of large-scale ‘anti-pest’ campaigns in the early 1950s, where suitable habitats were fragmented following deforestation and resettlement of people to rural areas, who hunted tigers and prey species. Though tiger hunting was prohibited in 1977, the population continued to decline and is considered extinct in southern China since 2001.  In  's  , camera-traps recorded a tiger with four cubs for the first time in 2012.  During subsequent surveys, between 27 and 34 tigers were documented along the China–Russia border.  Having earlier rejected the Western-led environmentalist movement, China changed its stance in the 1980s and became a party to the   treaty. By 1993 it had banned the trade in tiger parts, and this diminished the use of tiger bones in  .  The  's trade in tiger skins has also been a threat to tigers. The pelts were used in clothing, tiger-skin   being worn as fashion. In 2006 the   was persuaded to take up the issue. Since then there has been a change of attitude, with some Tibetans publicly burning their chubas. 
 In 1994, the Indonesian Sumatran Tiger Conservation Strategy addressed the potential crisis that tigers faced in Sumatra. The Sumatran Tiger Project (STP) was initiated in June 1995 in and around the   in order to ensure the long-term viability of wild Sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations.  By August 1999, the teams of the STP had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in Lampung Province, of which only 15 these were intact enough to contain tigers.  In the framework of the STP a community-based conservation programme was initiated to document the tiger-human dimension in the park in order to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions. 
 The   and   formed the collaboration  , with field sites including the world's largest tiger reserve, the 21,756 km  (8,400 sq mi)   in Myanmar. Other reserves were in the   in India, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, the Russian Far East covering in total about 260,000 km  (100,000 sq mi). 
 Tigers have been studied in the wild using a variety of techniques. Tiger population have been estimated using plaster casts of their  , although this method was criticized as being inaccurate.  More recent techniques include the use of   and studies of   from tiger scat, while   has been used to track tigers in the wild.  Tiger spray has been found to be just as good, or better, as a source of DNA than scat. 
 The tiger has been one of the   animals of  . Tiger hunting took place on a large scale in the early 19th and 20th centuries, being a recognised and admired sport by the   in   as well as the   and aristocratic class of the erstwhile princely states of pre-independence India. A single maharaja or English hunter could claim to kill over a hundred tigers in their hunting career.  Tiger hunting was done by some hunters on foot; others sat up on   with a goat or buffalo tied out as bait; yet others on elephant-back. 
 Historically, tigers have been hunted at a large scale so their famous striped skins could be collected. The trade in tiger skins peaked in the 1960s, just before international conservation efforts took effect. By 1977, a tiger skin in an   market was considered to be worth US$4,250. 
 Tiger parts are commonly used as   in   and  . In the Philippines, the fossils in Palawan were found besides stone tools. This, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, suggests that early humans had accumulated the bones,  and the condition of the tiger subfossils, dated to approximately 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, differed from other fossils in the assemblage, dated to the  . The tiger subfossils showed longitudinal fracture of the   due to weathering, which suggests that they had   been exposed to light and air. Tiger canines were found in Ambangan sites dating to the   to   centuries in  ,  . 
 Many people in China and other parts of Asia have a belief that various tiger parts have medicinal properties, including as pain killers and  .  There is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs. The use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical drugs in China is already banned, and the government has made some offences in connection with tiger poaching punishable by death.  Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the   and a domestic trade ban has been in place in China since 1993. 
 However, the trading of tiger parts in   has become a major black market industry and governmental and conservation attempts to stop it have been ineffective to date.  Almost all black marketers engaged in the trade are based in   and have either been shipped and sold within in their own country or into  ,   or  .  The Chinese subspecies was almost completely decimated by killing for commerce due to both the parts and skin trades in the 1950s through the 1970s.  Contributing to the illegal trade, there are a number of tiger farms in the country specialising in breeding the cats for profit. It is estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 captive-bred, semi-tame animals live in these farms today.  However, many tigers for traditional medicine black market are wild ones shot or snared by   and may be caught anywhere in the tiger's remaining range (from Siberia to India to the   to  ). In the Asian black market, a tiger penis can be worth the equivalent of around $300  . In the years of 1990 through 1992, 27 million products with tiger derivatives were found.  In July 2014 at an international convention on endangered species in  ,  , a Chinese representative admitted for the first time his government was aware trading in tiger skins was occurring in China. 
 Wild tigers that have had no prior contact with humans actively avoid interactions with humans. However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal.  Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between a mother and her young,  or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle.  Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey.  For example, the  , a tigress found in   and then  , had two broken canines. She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, by the time she was shot in 1907 by  .  According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch.  Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics. 
 Man-eaters have been a particular problem in recent decades in India and Bangladesh, especially in  ,   and the   mangrove swamps of  , where some healthy tigers have hunted humans. Because of rapid habitat loss attributed to  , tiger attacks have increased in the Sundarbans.  The Sundarbans area had 129 human deaths from tigers from 1969 to 1971. In the 10 years prior to that period, about 100 attacks per year in the Sundarbans, with a high of around 430 in some years of the 1960s.  Unusually, in some years in the Sundarbans, more humans are killed by tigers than vice versa.  In 1972, India's production of   and beeswax dropped by 50% when at least 29 people who gathered these materials were devoured.  In 1986 in the Sundarbans, since tigers almost always attack from the rear, masks with human faces were worn on the back of the head, on the theory that tigers usually do not attack if seen by their prey. This decreased the number of attacks only temporarily. All other means to prevent attacks, such as providing more prey or using electrified human dummies, did not work as well. 
 In   times, tigers were kept in   and   to be exhibited, trained and paraded, and were often provoked to fight humans and exotic beasts.  Since the 17th century, tigers, being rare and ferocious, were sought after to keep at European   as symbols of their owners' power.  Tigers became central   and   exhibits in the 18th century: a tiger could cost up to 4,000   in France (for comparison, a professor of the Beaux-Arts at Lyons earned only 3,000 francs a year),  or up to $3,500 in the United States, where a lion cost no more than $1,000. 
 In 2007, over 4,000 captive tigers lived in China, of which 3,000 were held by about 20 larger facilities, with the rest held by some 200 smaller facilities.  In 2011, 468 facilities in the USA kept 2,884 tigers.  Nineteen US states banned private ownership of tigers, fifteen require a license, and sixteen states have no regulation.    of 105 captive tigers from fourteen countries and regions showed that forty-nine animals belonged distinctly to five subspecies; fifty-two animals had mixed subspecies origins.  Many Siberian tigers in zoos today are actually the result of crosses with Bengal tigers." 
 Tigers and their superlative qualities have been a source of fascination for mankind since ancient times, and they are routinely visible as important cultural and media motifs. They are also considered one of the  , and are used as the face of conservation campaigns worldwide. In a 2004 online poll conducted by cable television channel  , involving more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog. 
 In   and  , the   is one of the 12 animals of the  . In  , the tiger is depicted as an earth symbol and equal rival of the   – the two representing matter and spirit respectively. The Southern Chinese martial art   is based on the movements of the tiger and the crane. In  , a tiger was the personification of war and often represented the highest army   (or present day  ),  while the emperor and empress were represented by a   and  , respectively.

 The   appears in stories from countries including China and Korea, it being generally inadvisable to grasp a tiger by the tail.  In   and  , the tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirits and a sacred creature that brings good luck – the symbol of courage and absolute power. For the people who live in and around the forests of Korea, the tiger considered the symbol of the Mountain Spirit or King of mountain animals. So, Koreans also called the tigers "San Gun" (산군) means Mountain Lord. 
 In  , the tiger is one of the Three Senseless Creatures, symbolising anger, with the monkey representing greed and the deer lovesickness.  The   considered the Siberian tiger a near-deity and often referred to it as "Grandfather" or "Old man". The   and   called it "Amba". The   considered the Siberian tiger as "Hu Lin," the king.  In  , the god   wears and sits on tiger skin.  The ten-armed warrior goddess   rides the tigress (or lioness) Damon into battle. In southern India the god   was associated with a tiger.

 In  's poem in his   (1794), titled " ", the tiger is a menacing and fearful animal.  In  's 2001   winning novel  , the protagonist, surviving shipwreck for months in a small boat, somehow avoids being eaten by the other survivor, a large Bengal tiger. The story was adapted in  's 2012  .   's 1944   tells ten true stories of his tiger-hunting exploits in what is now the northern   region of India. The book has sold over four million copies,  and has been the basis of both fictional and documentary films. In  's 1894  , the tiger,  , is the mortal enemy of the human protagonist,  .

 Tigers are also mascots for various   around the world.   is a famous mascot for      .  The   brand of petrol was advertised from 1959 onwards with the slogan 'put a tiger in your tank', and a tiger mascot; more than 2.5 million synthetic tiger tails were sold to motorists, who tied them to their petrol tank caps. 
 The tiger is one of the animals displayed on the   of the  . The tiger was the emblem of the   and was depicted on coins, seals and banners.  The seals of several Chola copper coins show the tiger, the   emblem fish and the   emblem bow, indicating that the Cholas had achieved political supremacy over the latter two dynasties. Gold coins found in Kavilayadavalli in the   of   have motifs of the tiger, bow and some indistinct marks.  The tiger symbol of Chola Empire was later adopted by the   and the tiger became a symbol of the unrecognised state of   and Tamil independence movement.

 The  , a depiction of tigers as they were understood by European artists, is among the creatures used in charges and supporters in European heraldry. This creature has several notable differences from real tigers, including absent stripes, a leonine tufted tail, and a head terminating in large, pointed jaws. A more realistic version of the tiger entered the heraldic armory through the  's expansion into Asia, and is referred to as the Bengal tiger to distinguish it from its older counterpart. The Bengal tiger is not a very common creature in heraldry, but is present as a supporter in the arms of   and emblazoned on the shield of the  .

Based on the best available information, tiger populations are stable or increasing in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Russia and China. An estimated 3,900 tigers remain in the wild, but much more work is needed to protect this species if we are to secure its future in the wild. In some areas, including much of Southeast Asia, tigers are still in crisis and declining in number. Map data provided by  There are two recognized subspecies of tiger*: the continental ( ) and the Sunda ( ). The largest of all the Asian big cats, tigers rely primarily on sight and sound rather than smell for hunting. They typically hunt alone and stalk prey. A tiger can consume more than 80 pounds of meat at one time. On average, tigers give birth to two to four cubs every two years. If all the cubs in one litter die, a second litter may be produced within five months. Tigers generally gain independence at around two years of age and attain sexual maturity at age three or four for females and four or five years for males. Juvenile mortality is high, however—about half of all cubs do not survive more than two years. Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild. Males of the larger subspecies, the continental tiger, may weigh up to 660 pounds. For males of the smaller subspecies—the Sunda tiger—the upper range is at around 310 pounds. Within both subspecies, males are heavier than females. Tigers are mostly solitary, apart from associations between mother and offspring. Individual tigers have a large territory, and the size is determined mostly by the availability of prey. Individuals mark their domain with urine, feces, rakes, scrapes, and vocalizing. Across their range, tigers face unrelenting pressures from poaching, retaliatory killings, and habitat loss. They are forced to compete for space with dense and often growing human populations. Illegal snaring is a rampant threat to wildlife and people in the forests of Southeast Asia. Snares are used to capture animals for the illegal wildlife trade. WWF-supported ranger patrols are working to address this crisis by removing snares.  This big cat is a critical part of ecosystems and cultures. If forests are emptied of every last tiger, all that will remain are distant legends and zoo sightings. The tiger has evolved over millions of years. Currently, this big cat is being trapped, its parts trafficked for various purposes, and pushed out of its home. Many that are left in the wild cling to survival in isolated patches of forest scattered across Asia. To save tigers, we need to secure forest and grassland habitats across Asia where they live. By protecting large, biologically diverse landscapes, we allow tigers to roam and preserve the many other threatened species that live there. To protect just one tiger, we have to conserve an estimated 10,000 hectares of forest. As a large predator, the tiger plays a key role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. These ecosystems supply both nature and people with fresh water, food, and health. Securing tiger landscapes could help protect at least nine major watersheds, which regulate and provide freshwater for over 800 million people in Asia.   Tigers can directly help some of the world’s poorest communities. Tourists go to some places where tigers exist, creating opportunities for communities with few alternatives to earn money. Tiger conservation projects also help provide alternative livelihoods for rural communities, helping to bring in income and generating employment opportunities.

Every part of the tiger—from whisker to tail—has been found in illegal wildlife markets. A result of persistent demand, their bones, and other body parts are used for modern health tonics and folk remedies, and their skins are sought after as status symbols among some Asian cultures. There are often limited resources for guarding protected areas in the countries where tigers live. Even countries with strong enforcement of tiger protection laws continue to fight a never-ending battle against poaching, which is now often orchestrated by transnational crime syndicates that rake in significant profits from wildlife crime and undermine the security of local communities. The impact from the death of a single tiger at the hands of poachers reaches beyond one single loss. If a female tiger with cubs is killed, her cubs will most likely die without their mother, and the female's potential for future breeding is lost. If a male is killed, his death can result in intense competition for his territory among surviving males in the population, leading to potential injury and death. Tigers have lost an estimated 95% of their historical range. Their habitat has been destroyed, degraded, and fragmented by human activities. The clearing of forests for agriculture and timber, as well as the building of road networks and other development activities, pose serious threats to tiger habitats. Tigers need wide swaths of habitat for their survival since they have large home ranges and are very territorial. Fewer tigers can survive in small, scattered islands of habitat, which leads to a higher risk of inbreeding and makes tigers more vulnerable to poaching as they venture beyond protected areas to establish their territories. This underscores the need to ensure habitat connectivity between the protected areas where tigers live. People and tigers increasingly compete for space. As forests shrink and prey becomes scarce, tigers are forced to leave protected areas in search of food and to establish territories. This takes them into human-dominated areas that lie between habitat fragments, where they can hunt domestic livestock that many local communities depend on for their livelihood. In retaliation, tigers are sometimes killed or captured. “Conflict” tigers can end up for sale in black markets. Local community dependence on forests for fuel wood, food, and timber heightens the risk of tiger attacks on people. One of the world’s largest, and most uniquely-adapted, tiger populations are found in the Sundarbans—a large mangrove forest area shared by India and Bangladesh on the coast of the Indian Ocean. It is also the only coastal mangrove tiger habitat in the world. These mangrove forests harbor a variety of species, including tigers, and protect coastal regions from storm surges and wind damage. However, rising sea levels caused by climate change threaten to wipe out these forests and the last remaining habitat of this tiger population. According to a WWF study, without mitigation efforts, projected sea-level rise—about a foot by 2070—could destroy nearly the entire Sundarbans tiger habitat. Current estimates indicate that there are more than 8,000 tigers being held in more than 200 centers in East and Southeast Asia, with roughly three-quarters of these tigers located in China. The current scale of commercial captive breeding efforts within these farms is a significant obstacle to the recovery and protection of wild tiger populations because they perpetuate the demand for tiger products, serve as a cover for illegal trade and undermine enforcement efforts. WWF is engaging with governments in countries with active tiger farms, and advocates ending breeding and phasing out the farms. WWF also advocates for improved regulation of the   It is estimated that approximately 5,000 tigers reside in the US, and we must ensure that these animals are not exploited by, or contributing to, the illegal trade in tigers and their parts. As demonstrated in a number of areas, wild tigers can recover. In 2010, the 13 tiger range countries committed to TX2—doubling wild tiger numbers by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger. In pursuing TX2, WWF and its partners have taken a comprehensive approach to tiger conservation. WWF works to enforce zero tolerance for tiger poaching across Asia. We help build the capacity of government enforcement units in each landscape and install the best new technologies to assist local agencies by achieving conservation results. We help improve the effectiveness of wildlife rangers by training personnel from enforcement agencies on tools such as SMART (Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool). We also work to ensure that communities have a stake in conservation, as they are typically the best stewards and managers of their natural resources. Tigers need secure areas to thrive, and our work to protect and connect their fragile habitat is based on rigorous scientific analysis. WWF has chosen places to focus its resources based on the best available science and where tigers have the best chance of recovery and long-term persistence. The locations encompass tiger corridors that link tiger sites within landscapes. Our work includes building local capacity to manage protected areas, coordinating with partners to manage core tiger areas and corridors, and addressing human-wildlife conflict and the impacts of infrastructure development in tiger landscapes. To ensure effective conservation management of tiger sites, the Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CA|TS) provide a minimum set of standards to encourage the long-term success of tiger conservation and best practices in these areas. Nine of the 13 tiger range countries are currently implementing CA|TS or in discussions on registering, and two sites have achieved CA|TS approval by meeting all the required standards. Monitoring tigers and their prey is essential to achieving our goal of doubling wild tiger populations. By employing camera traps, tracking technologies and DNA collected from scat (droppings), we analyze the progress of tiger populations in order to adapt our strategies and make conservation decisions based on strong science and field experience. WWF works with governments across the 13 tiger range countries with wild tiger populations to build and maintain momentum around the conservation of tigers, which is an asset that can enhance their development agendas. By linking tiger conservation with forest preservation and carbon sequestration efforts, tiger range nations and their partners can demonstrate their commitment to promoting a healthy environmental and economic future. Trade in tiger parts and products is a major threat to wild tiger survival. Together with TRAFFIC, the global wildlife trade monitoring network, we implement strategies to help governments stop wildlife criminal networks, shut down black markets and change consumer behavior. We conduct investigations to document the tiger trade, catalyze action against it and help train enforcement agencies. We continue to build strategies to reduce demand for tiger parts and products and shut down tiger “farms”. Forests in Asia, home to elephants, tigers and other endangered species—are often cleared to make room for growing rubber trees. They are among the most threatened forests in the world. That’s why WWF has set an ambitious goal of transforming the global rubber market. Tiger ‘farms’ are captive facilities that breed tigers to supply or directly engage in the commercial trade of tiger parts or products. WWF is calling for greater oversight and protection of all captive tigers. Ask your member of Congress to ensure laws are in place to protect tigers from illegal wildlife trade. Make a symbolic tiger adoption to help save some of the world's most endangered animals from extinction and support WWF's conservation efforts.

To help tiger populations recover, WWF is working to improve tiger habitat, reduce human-tiger conflict and engage local communities. The tiger (Panthera tigris) is one of the world’s most recognizable animals, intimately connected with strength and untamed nature. A symbol of nature’s wild places, significant in faiths and folktales of almost all civilizations, tigers inspire millions of people around the globe, from the monasteries in Bhutan to the catwalks of Milan. Sadly, tigers are on the brink of extinction. Just over a century ago, 100,000 wild tigers roamed across Asia. Today, fewer than 3,900 live in a mere four per cent of their historic range. The largest tiger population can now be found in India, home to half of all remaining wild tigers. Much of this decline has occurred in the past decade. Endangered  A wildlife species facing imminent extirpation or extinction. 100 – 300 kg 2 - 3 metres Approximately 3,900 individuals Tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of 11 countries in Asia A tiger's roar can be heard as far as 3 kilometres. These beautiful, powerful cats inhabit diverse landscapes, from rainforests to grasslands, savannahs to mangrove forests and high-elevation habitats, so they play an important role in many ecosystems that supply nature and people with water, food and room to roam. As top predators in the food chain, tigers help keep their habitats balanced by preying on other animals, mainly herbivores. Too many herbivores would lead to overgrazing and degradation of the ecosystem. Tigers also drive economies. Where tigers exist, tourists go. And where tourists go, money can be made by communities with few alternatives for income. Tiger conservation projects help provide alternative livelihoods for rural communities. To safeguard tigers, we need to protect large swaths of forest across Asia where they live. By protecting these biologically diverse places, we can also preserve many other endangered species that live there. And, forests protected for tigers are known to store more carbon than other habitat types, helping to mitigate climate change. The most immediate threat to wild tigers is poaching. Their body parts are in relentless demand for traditional medicine and are status symbols within some Asian cultures. Resources for guarding protected areas where tigers live are usually limited. People and tigers increasingly compete for space. Tigers have lost 93 per cent of their historical range due to human activity and development. As forests shrink and prey becomes scarce, tigers are forced to hunt domestic livestock, which many local communities depend on for their livelihoods. In retaliation, tigers are killed or captured. These “conflict tigers” are commonly sold on the black market. We can’t lose our tigers. Your support makes a big difference towards our work to help recover tiger populations.

Charitable Registration Number #119304954 RR 0001 Given the lack of tournament preparation, it doesn't say much for  ' confidence in his own body that he is not in Memphis, Tennessee, this week in advance of next week's PGA Championship. Sure, there are other compelling explanations to skip the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational, chief among them the fact that he has never seen the TPC Southwind course. Throw in the sweltering heat, good chances for thunderstorms (and delays) and the extreme temperature difference between Memphis and San Francisco the following week for the PGA Championship, and there are plenty of good reasons to take it easy this week, work on the game at home, and be fully ready for the delayed first major of 2020. As Woods said on Friday in announcing that he would be skipping the WGC, he is "doing what I think is best to prepare for the PGA Championship and upcoming FedEx Cup playoffs.'' Answer questions on the PGA Championship for a chance to win $5,000!  Fair enough. Woods knows better than anyone how his body is reacting these days, and the parts of his game that need work. But it is nonetheless telling that he is not competing, especially when you consider he has just four tournament rounds to his name since February -- and plenty of competitive rust still showing. Woods has always been a big supporter of the World Golf Championship events, rarely skipping them when healthy, save for a few Match Play misses over the years. Woods has said many times he appreciates the PGA Tour's efforts in securing these big-money events. And he has won 18 of them. Eight of those came at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, where he dominated the Firestone Country Club course. And eight times he played that tournament the week before the PGA Championship -- the only major as a pro in which has played the week prior -- so there was precedent for him to do so. And yet, he took a pass, despite some of the flaws in his game and the lack of preparation. It's easy to second-guess now, but perhaps one of the earlier events (RBC Heritage or Travelers?) in the PGA Tour's restart from the   would have made sense, especially given the possibility of skipping the WGC. Consecutive events is always going to be dicey for Woods, but given his rather lackluster performance at the Memorial, where he twice shot 76 and tied for 40th, it might have been understood. Of course, the second-round 76 was due in large part to back stiffness that was obvious. Woods could not hide his discomfort, and the shot patterns -- he missed seven tee shots to the right in the second round -- along with several awkward or one-handed swings were clues. So Woods has some work to do this week to get ready for the PGA, which will be played at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, a venue where he has had success. Woods won the 2005 WGC-American Express Invitational there in 2005 in a playoff over John Daly. And at the 2009 Presidents Cup, he went 5-0. But those events were a long time ago. "I competed and played again,'' he said after the final round at the Memorial. "It's been a while. It was nice to get my feet wet and compete again. Tough, tough conditions to start out my first week back. But it was good to get the feel and the flow of competing again.'' That sounds great if it followed his first event of the year in January, with a slow buildup to the Masters. But Tiger has some ground to cover this week, and here are a few things to keep in mind. Woods is scrutinized like no other and often judged by his own lofty standards and expectations. With a bit of perspective, his showing at the Memorial was decent, if not great, but far from awful. He returned at Muirfield Village on the most difficult setup to date of the revised schedule, on a course that played like a major championship over the weekend. That was no simple foray back into golf. Perhaps most impressive: Woods was tied for sixth in strokes gained approach to the green and tied for 18th in greens in regulation with 62.5%. The man can still hit his irons with the best of them. That is always important in a major championship. Anecdotally and statistically, Woods' swing speed was less than it has been, which is both good and bad. It's good in that he is no longer swinging so violently. There were plenty of long tee shots, well over 300 yards, and on the weekend especially, the swing looked smooth. The lack of speed could be by design or because he was being careful. Given all the time away for Woods, it was a bit surprising to see some of those numbers decrease. In 2018, Woods averaged 178 mph ball speed; it was mostly under 170 at the Memorial and his average carry was less than 280 yards. But it's not necessarily a negative, unless other parts of his game are not good. Woods was a mediocre 42nd in strokes gained off the tee, meaning he was giving up ground to the field. His driving accuracy was 55%, which is so-so but needs to be better, especially since many of the misses were with clubs other than the driver. This is one of those confounding things about Tiger's game. Statistically, he often hits the ball closer to the hole compared to his peers from 180 yards than he does from 100. That's the key to par-5 scoring, and Woods was just 1 under for the week at Muirfield Village. He also hit just 75% of the greens from 100 to 125 yards. This has to improve, and Tiger said so himself. "I didn't feel comfortable playing break,'' Woods said. "I've been in Florida playing Bermuda [greens] and seeing minimal break. Come out here and playing 10, 12 feet of break was a bit different and something I'm going to have to get used to.'' Understandable, really. It's not like Tiger has been playing a bevy of courses at home. At the Memorial, he was 56th in strokes gained putting, losing ground to the field. He also missed several short ones. All of that can be cleaned up. The good news for Woods is Harding Park does not have the traditional California poa annua greens that sometimes give him fits. (Think Riviera, for example.) They are bent grass, like the surface at Muirfield Village and Augusta National. Woods plays on Bermuda at home, but those are typically up to tour-level speeds. Bent can be faster, but it's generally smooth, exactly how he likes it. It would make sense for Woods to get to Harding Park early, perhaps this weekend, to get to work on learning those greens. It almost sounds silly, but a golfer has to learn how to walk when he hasn't been playing tournament golf. Woods undoubtedly played plenty of golf at his home course, the Medalist in South Florida, but there is scant evidence that he did much walking. His caddie, Joe LaCava -- who often prods him to do this when he is around -- was not summoned to Florida prior to Woods' return. Most of the golf was done out of cart, and that makes sense on some levels. Woods wants to work on his game, and zipping around allows for more time to get on the range and get in the gym. But there is still something to be said for going through the motions of hitting a drive, walking to the ball, hitting an approach, walking to the green ... and never sitting down. Think about it. That is virtually how every round of golf on tour is played, with perhaps a time or two when Woods sits on his bag while play has slowed down. It takes getting used to that rhythm, and standing for long periods of time and walking more than 5 miles in extreme heat takes a toll -- not to mention is cause for a stiff back. Harding Park is not a strenuous walk, and the temperatures won't climb much above the low 70s. But it is something to watch. Woods has rarely gone into a major championship with so little tournament preparation, with a few notable exceptions. He will go to Harding Park having played just one of the previous eight weeks in the tour's restart. That puts him well behind almost every other top player, save for Adam Scott, who has not played during the restart. Throw in the lack of action for Woods since he played the Genesis Invitational -- and he has played just one of the past 11 events. In 2015, Woods took off nine weeks due to chipping and back woes following a withdrawal from the Farmers Insurance Open. He started that year with a missed cut and then the WD and didn't play again until the Masters, where he tied for 17th. In 2011, Woods suffered Achilles and knee injuries at the Masters, withdrew after nine holes of the Players Championship, then didn't play again until the WGC-Bridgestone in August, the week prior to the PGA, where he missed the cut. In 2010, Woods did not play at all until the Masters in the aftermath of his personal issues. That he managed to tie for fourth -- he opened with a 68 -- and was in contention on the final day was a remarkable achievement given all that swirled around him at the time. In 2008, Woods did not play between the Masters and U.S. Open, undergoing what was supposed to be a minor knee procedure but leading to small fractures in the bone of his left leg and an eventual ACL replacement. He won the U.S. Open despite all those issues. Bottom line, throughout his career, Woods has had far more tournament preparation going into a major than he has now. Woods referenced the FedEx Cup playoffs in his tweet announcing he would not play this week. If he is intent on getting to Atlanta for the Tour Championship, he has some work to do, and it will be interesting to see how he attempts to handle it. Following the 3M Open, Woods dropped to 45th in the FedEx Cup standings (and to 15th in the Official World Golf Ranking) and is likely to drop further after missing the WGC this week. That means he could use a good week at the PGA Championship to move closer to the top 30, which will be needed for him to make it to Atlanta. Here's the problem Woods faces: The first playoff event, the Northern Trust at TPC-Boston, is just two weeks after the PGA. That event has a 36-hole cut. It's unlikely he would play three straight weeks in the playoffs, so does he sit out the Northern Trust and wait for the top 70 at the BMW? If so, he might put himself in a position where he is too far behind and in need of a big finish. So does he instead go to Boston with hopes of sitting out Chicago? Or does he consider playing both and taking his chances on a third straight week in Atlanta if he makes it? Tough decisions. After all, the rescheduled U.S. Open is just two weeks after the Tour Championship. Woods needs to play, but he doesn't want to play too much. Woods is undoubtedly not concerned about that now. A big week in San Francisco looms. This powerful feline predator moves with a deadly grace, its reddish-orange fur slashed with black stripes.

They weigh from 400 to 600 pounds. Tigers are usually the top animal predators in their territories, and have been known to kill bears, crocodiles, giant snakes, wolves, and even other great cats. Even humanoids are far from safe, especially in cases where a tiger has developed a taste for humanoid flesh. Tigers prefer terrain with plenty of cover and proximity to water as their hunting grounds.

The tiger is   throughout its range, which stretches from the Russian Far East through parts of  ,  ,  , and   to the Indonesian island of  . The  , or Amur, tiger ( ) is the largest, measuring up to 4 metres (13 feet) in total length and weighing up to 300 kg (660 pounds). The Indian, or  , tiger ( ) is the most numerous and accounts for about half of the total tiger population. Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder height of about 1 metre and a length of about 2.2 metres, excluding a tail of about 1 metre; weight is 160–230 kg (350–500 pounds), and tigers from the south are smaller than those of the north. The   ( ), and   ( ) tigers are bright reddish tan, beautifully marked with dark, almost black, vertical stripes. The underparts, the inner sides of the limbs, the cheeks, and a large spot over each   are whitish. The rare Siberian tiger has longer, softer, and paler fur.  White tigers, not all of them true albinos, have occurred from time to time, almost all of them in India (   ).  Black tigers have been reported less frequently from the dense forests of   (Burma),  , and eastern India. The tiger has no mane, but in old males the hair on the cheeks is rather long and spreading. Although most classifications separate the   into six subspecies, some merge subspecies or suggest that two tiger species exist,   on the mainland of Asia and   of  ,  , and Sumatra. The tiger has adapted to a great variety of  , from the Siberian  , where nights can be as cold as −40 °C (−40 °F), to the   swamps of the  , where the temperatures reach more than 40 °C (104 °F). Tigers haunt the ruins of buildings such as courts and temples and are at home in   ranging from dry   to  . Grasslands, mixed grassland-forests, and   rather than densely canopied forests support maximum population densities, as these habitats maintain the highest number of prey species. Having evolved in the temperate and subtropical forests of eastern Asia, the tiger is less tolerant of   than other large cats, which may explain why it is an adept swimmer that appears to enjoy bathing. Under stress it may climb trees. The tiger usually hunts by night and preys on a variety of animals, but it prefers fairly large prey such as   ( ,  , and swamp deer) and wild  . A special liking for  , despite the danger of injury from their quills, is an exception. Healthy large   are generally avoided, although there have been recorded instances of the tiger’s having attacked   and adult  .   are occasionally taken from human habitations, and some tigers can thrive on domestic  . After making a kill and consuming what it can, it makes a deliberate attempt to hide the carcass from   and other scavengers so that another meal can be obtained. Tigers are not averse to commandeering a kill from other tigers or  , and they sometimes eat carrion. Skill in killing and obtaining prey is only partly instinctive, maternal training being essential for proficiency. For this reason, tigers raised in captivity would not fare well if released into the wild. As the   throughout its range, the tiger plays a major role in controlling not only its prey   but that of other predators such as the leopard,   (Asiatic wild dog), and  . No trait of the tiger has fascinated humans more than  man eating. A number of reasons account for this—disability caused by age or injury, paucity of prey, acquisition of the habit from the mother, or defense of cubs or kill. With the reduction in the number of tigers, the occurrence of man-eating tigers has become rare except in the Sundarbans, the northeast Indian state of  , and neighbouring   in and around Royal Chitwan National Park. As solitary animals, tigers (especially males) establish and maintain their own territories, the size and nature of which vary with the number and distribution of prey, the presence of other tigers in the area, the nature of the terrain, the availability of  , and individual characteristics. Spacing between individuals and maintenance of territories are achieved through  , scrapings on the ground,   marking of  , fecal deposits, scent deposited by the rubbing of facial glands, and spraying of   mixed with scent secreted from the anal glands. The solitary nature of the species also helps minimize territorial conflict. Nonetheless, confrontations do occur, sometimes resulting in injury and even death. The readiness of a tigress to   is announced through vocalization and scent production. There is no fixed breeding season, though the preponderance of mating appears to occur in winter, with striped cubs being born after a gestation period of more than three months. The normal litter size is two to four, though up to seven cubs have been recorded. They are born blind, and, even when their eyes open, opacity prevents clear vision for six to eight weeks. There is thus a long period of weaning, tutelage, and training during which cub mortality is high, especially if food is scarce. During this time the offspring must endure long periods of absence by the mother while she is away hunting. Weaker cubs get less food because of the aggressiveness of their stronger siblings as food is less frequently made available. The cubs remain with the mother until about the second year, when they are nearly adult and are able to kill prey for themselves. Male cubs grow more quickly than females and tend to leave their mother earlier. Though cub infanticide (mainly by males) is known, it is not very unusual to find a male with a tigress and cubs, even sharing a kill. Such associations, however, do not last long. The tigress does not breed again until her cubs are independent. The average life span of a tiger in the wild is about 11 years. Adults can weigh up to  They mainly feed on large mammals such as  ,  ,   and  .

 There are only around 3,900 tigers in the wild. With the support of Tiger Protectors around the world, they are beginning to make a comeback. 
 
                                Affected by:
                                                                    Illegal wildlife trade
                                    ,                                                                    Human wildlife conflict
                                    ,                                                                    Habitat loss and fragmentation
                                                                                                 The beautiful, awe-inspiring tiger is one of our planet’s most iconic animals. But here’s the shocking truth. Wild tiger numbers dropped by more than 95% since the beginning of the 20th century. Now, for the first time in conservation history, their numbers are on the increase. We aim to help double the number of wild tigers to over 6,000 by 2022 – the next Chinese year of the tiger. In recent years, conservation work and the commitment of various governments has halted the decline in global tiger numbers. But there’s a lot more work to do. We’re working closely with governments and community groups across Asia – and your support is crucial, as always. Will you join us and help protect this amazing wild cat? "I am proud to be engaged in supporting our work on tigers, at such an unprecedented and exciting time in history where wild tiger numbers are starting to increase globally. In my lifetime, tiger populations declined, but are now on the up. That’s quite incredible. However, the threats remain, and we need to do all we can to help achieve the very ambitious goal of doubling the number of tigers in the wild by 2022 – a goal which was set in 2010 when the wild tiger population was at an all-time low." 
 Tigers used to roam across most of Asia, but now they’re restricted to just 7% of their original range, in isolated forests and grasslands across 13 countries. 
 As top predators, tigers help to keep their environment healthy. It’s the way things naturally work in the wild – the predators prey on other animals, in this case herbivores (plant-eaters) such as deer. But without enough tigers to eat them, herbivores can overgraze and damage the land, disrupting the balance of the local environment.  Local people also depend on a healthy environment for food, water and lots of other resources. By helping protect tigers we’re also helping look after the places where they live, which is good for all the people and wildlife sharing that environment. 
    
                                “Tigers are powerful, they are beautiful, they are perfect… and they can coexist with humans.”

Pavel Fomenko is a Tiger Protector in Russia. He knows the forests of the Russian Far East like the back of his hand, and uses this knowledge to help protect the endangered Amur tiger. 

It’s a lonely and dangerous job. Pavel has been known to spend 40 days in a row alone in the wilderness, where temperatures drop well below -30C in winter months. 

Pavel is a passionate and talented conservationist . His work involves supporting a complex system of tiger protection involving tracking poachers, performing forensics on animal remains and monitoring tiger numbers in the Russian Far East. Tiger Protectors like Pavel are a key part of the efforts that have seen wild tiger numbers begin to rise globally. 

                             
                                “My parents and husband are my tower of strength. They think my job is very special and unique for a woman, but at the same time they’re worried sick about my safety when I’m in the field.”

Singye Wangmo is one of only a few female forestry officers working in Bhutan. Her role requires her to leave her husband, parents and pets at home while she spends weeks working in the field protecting around 30 wild tigers and other wildlife that live in Bhutan’s Royal Manas National Park.

Leading a team of 30 rangers, Singye’s job involves the monitoring of tigers through camera traps, 
conducting surveys on foot and patrolling known poaching hotspots. Poaching groups often venture in to the park, but Singye is determined to continue the work she has been doing for 3 years: “The fight to save tigers is our collective responsibility. Human beings are the answer to saving tigers. You and I are the answer.”

                             
                                “We’re not going to lose tigers. Let’s stay positive.”

Ollie, tiger protector and committed conservationist, devotes his free time and energy to raising funds to protect tigers. Ollie first ran for charity in 2013, when he and his fiancé raised £600 for tigers by running the Edinburgh Rock ‘n’ Roll half marathon. 

Last year he covered over 500 miles running both the London and Paris marathons, and completing a Richmond Park duathlon. This served as perfect training for the Royal Parks Foundation half marathon, in which he donned a tiger onesie and raised £350.

                             
 
                            In the UK, some trade of elephant ivory is still legal.

We are using our skills, expertise and resources to stop the illegal wildlife trade&nbsp;by expanding the scope and impact of our work.&nbsp;

 Tigers are the largest felines in the world and as such, many cultures consider the tiger to be a symbol of strength, courage and dignity. The tiger is one of the twelve Chinese zodiac animals, and those born in the "Year of the Tiger" are thought to be brave, competitive and self-confident. However, because hunting them is also a sign of bravery in some cultures, tigers are endangered. Tigers are hunted for their meat, pelt and body parts that are used in folk remedies. To make matters worse, these great cats have lost most of their habitat due to logging, road building and development, according to  . Experts estimate there are no more than 3,200 tigers left in the wild. Most tigers have the characteristic orange fur with black or brown stripes, but these markings vary between subspecies. For example, the very large Siberian tiger has pale orange fur with few stripes, while the smaller Sumatran tigers in the Sunda Islands have dark, thickly striped fur. No two tigers have the same markings, and their stripes are as individual as fingerprints are for humans. In the wild, a tiger's stripes are important for survival, as they act as camouflage, appearing as moving shadows in long grass and in trees, according to  . The white Bengal tigers seen in some zoos are the result of a recessive gene, and are not albinos. In fact, it's unlikely that true albino tigers (with pink eyes) exist. Some historical reports detail tigers with black fur and tan stripes, caused by excessive pigmentation, but these accounts are extremely rare. On the backs of each ear, tigers have a white spot of fur, called ocelli, according to  . It's likely the spots act as fake eyes and they may also help tigers communicate with one another. A tiger's hind legs are longer than its front legs, allowing it to jump up to 32.5 feet (10 meters), according to  . Tiger claws are up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) long, and are used to grab and hold onto their prey. The largest tiger subspecies, the Siberian, also called Amur, are 10.75 feet (3.3 m) long and weigh up to 660 pounds (300 kilograms), according to  . The smallest tiger is the Sumatran, which weighs 165 - 308 pounds (74 - 139 kg), according to the   (WWF). Tigers also have very long tails, which can add around 3 feet (one m) to their overall length, according to  . Wild tigers live in Asia. Larger subspecies, such as the Siberian tiger, tend to live in northern, colder areas, such as eastern Russia and northeastern China. Smaller subspecies live in southern, warmer countries, such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. Depending on the subspecies, tigers live in a variety of environments, including arid forests, flooded mangrove forests, tropical forests and taiga (a cold forest with coniferous trees), according to the  . All tigers are carnivores. Most of a tiger's diet consists of large prey, such as pigs, deer, rhinos or elephant calves. To kill their prey, tigers clamp down on the animal's neck with their jaws and suffocate the animal. The tiger's canine teeth have pressure-sensing nerves, so it knows exactly where to deliver a fatal bite to its prey, according to the WWF. Though tigers are fierce hunters, they are no strangers to failure, as they are successful in only 10% of their hunts, according to  . Tigers are solitary creatures; they like to spend most of their time alone, roaming their massive territories looking for food. According to the  , the Siberian tiger has the largest range; its territory spans more than 4,000 square miles (10,000 square km). Tigers mark their territory by spraying a mix of urine and scent gland secretions onto trees and rocks. They also scratch marks into trees with their claws. Tiger babies are born helpless. At birth, a cub weighs 2.2 pounds (1 kg), and a female may have as many as seven cubs at a time, according to the  . Around half of all cubs don't live beyond the age of two, according to  . The mother must leave the cubs while she hunts, leaving them open to other predators. Most tiger mothers are unable to kill enough prey to feed a large litter, so some cubs may die of starvation. At just 8 weeks old, tiger cubs are ready to learn how to hunt and go out on hunting expeditions with their mother. At 2 years old, the cubs will set out on their own, and their mother will be ready for another set of cubs. In the wild, tigers typically live 10 to 15 years, according to  . For many years, scientists classified tigers into  : six living subspecies and three extinct ones. But in recent years, some researchers have challenged the traditional classification. A 2015 study published in the journal   argued that there are only two subspecies of tigers. However, a study published in the journal   in 2018 presented genomic evidence supporting six genetically distinct subspecies of tigers:the Bengal tiger ( ), the Amur tiger ( ), the South China tiger ( ), the Sumatran tiger ( ), the Indochinese tiger ( ), and the Malayan tiger ( ). The Javan tiger was last recorded in the 1970s, the Caspian tiger was lost in the 1950s, and the Bali tiger became extinct in the 1930s, according to  , a wild-cat conservation organization. There are more tigers in captivity than there are in the wild. According to the  , there are about 5,000 captive tigers in the United States alone, but there are fewer than 3,200 tigers in the wild. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN's) Red List of Threatened Species categorizes the  ,   and   tigers as endangered, and the  ,   and   Tigers as critically endangered. Most remaining tigers live on wildlife refuges to protect them from poachers. Poaching is by far the biggest threat facing tigers today. Illegal demand for tiger bones (used in tonics and medicines), tiger skin (seen as a status symbol) and other body parts, is driving the killing and trafficking, which has had an overwhelming impact on tiger populations and resulted in localized extinctions, according to  . The continued demand for tiger parts is pushing the species closer and closer to extinction. In addition to the threat of poaching, only 7% of the tiger's original range remains due to human agriculture, logging, settlements and roads.

     A female tiger gives birth to a litter of three or four cubs, who she will care for until they are a year-and-a-half old. These cubs quadruple in size during their first month! The powerful predator generally hunts alone, able to bring down prey such as deer and antelope. Tigers wait until dark to hunt. The tiger sprints to an unsuspecting animal, usually pulling it off its feet with its teeth and claws. If the prey animal is large, the   bites its throat to kill it; smaller prey is usually killed when the tiger breaks its neck. Tigers have been known to eat up to 60 pounds of meat in one night, but more often they consume about 12 pounds during a meal. It may take days for a   to finish eating its kill. The cat eats until it's full, and then covers the carcass with leaves and dirt. The tiger comes back to feed some more. Tigers live far apart from each other. A tiger knows if it is in another tiger’s territory based on the trees around him. Each tiger marks the trees in its area with urine and special scratches. Unlike most members of the cat family, tigers seem to enjoy water and  . Some tigers live where it gets very cold—in   and parts of southeast Asia. The whole species is endangered throughout its range. Tigers have been overhunted for their fur as well as for other body parts that many people use in traditional medicines. Tigers' habitat has also dwindled seriously as humans have developed land for uses such as farming and logging. However, in the Siberian region of  , there’s hope that these big cats are  . Because of their size, strength, and predatory skills, tigers are considered one of the    ,  ,  , and   are also part of this grouping. Tiger stripes are special to each individual, and their tails help them to keep their balance. The big cats share all but 4.4% of their DNA with  .

By now, it seems almost everyone with a Netflix account has watched "Tiger King" — or at least seen the memes. But for a docu-series that takes place at multiple animal parks and literally has the word "tiger" in the title, it didn't tell fans much about, uh, actual tigers or their conservation.  From the team at BBC Wildlife Magazine In our expert tiger guide, learn about the world's biggest cat and ferocious predator, including key species facts, how they hunt and best places to see in the wild. This competition is now closed 
   
 Tigers are the only big cats to have stripes and individuals can be identified by their pattern.But when it comes to predatory adaptations, you wouldn’t expect a coloration of bright orange with black stripes to be top of the list – in fact it might not be on the list at all. However, while we typically see tigers in zoos, conspicuous against the green vegetation in their enclosures, their main prey is ungulates, which cannot detect the range of colours that we primates can. To an animal with comparatively poor vision, the cat’s bold, contrasting colours are much harder to pick out in the long grass. This method of camouflage is an important predatory adaptation. Whereas some large felines rely on co-operative hunting (such as lions) or bursts of intense speed (such as cheetahs), tigers are semi-solitary and depend on their cryptic appearance to ambush prey.

 Tigers are carnivorous mammals, and they mostly eat large prey like deer, wild boar and even elephant calves. And yes, they have occasionally been known to kill and eat people, too. This usually only happens when a tiger is old, ill or injured, and therefore unable to catch their normal prey. But once a tiger has a taste for human meat, they often have to be killed to protect the local people. A tiger’s favourite way of taking down its prey is to lunge at the animal’s neck and hold on tight with its powerful jaws. The prey will normally die from suffocation, but some might bleed out first if the tiger’s canines sever an artery. Tigers are the biggest cat in the wild, yes. Male tigers can grow to be over 3m long and weigh up to 300kg, while female tigers tend to be a bit smaller. However, another big cat has been bred in captivity that’s even larger. If you breed a male lion with a female tiger, you get a liger. These truly enormous cats have no equal in the modern world, growing up to 3.6m long and being considerably heavier than even the biggest tigers – the largest living cat, Hercules the liger, weighs close to 420kg, and the record is a staggering 550kg. Tigers are relatively adaptable and historically lived across huge swathes of Asia. There are now very few left in South-East Asia, but they’re doing relatively well in India, Nepal, Russia and Bhutan. Tiger habitats vary by region, with the larger tigers of colder northern regions (like the Siberian tiger) living in the brutal taiga, while smaller tigers from warmer regions can happily live in arid forests, tropical rainforests and flooded swamplands and mangroves. Researchers think that India holds around half of the world’s remaining wild tigers. There are several Indian national parks that are renowned for their frequent tiger sightings, including Bandhavgarh, Ranthambore and Kanha national parks. Tigers have white spots surrounded by black fur on the back of their ears. It has been suggested that they act as false eyes to warn of their presence or discourage other species from attacking them from behind. Other theories suggest that it helps tiger cubs follow their mother through tall grass. Being an apex predator is tough and, for many species, most pursuits end in failure, while smaller hunters risk losing their hard-won meals to bigger beasts. But which is the deadliest animal and which predator has to work hardest to get a meal? Learn about apex predators and which are the most dangerous? 
 Tigers do not shy away from water and enjoy bathing in streams and lakes to escape the heat in hot climates. In tall grass, rock crevices or caves, tiger cubs are born blind and depend on their mother for protection. Females usually give birth to two to three cubs but can have as many as six. Each litter has a dominant cub who is more active than their siblings and takes the lead in their play. This sibling is usually the first to leave its mother. After 15 months the matured cubs will disperse and find their own territories. In the wild, tigers have a 14 year life span. Once mature, they will spend most of their time living and hunting alone, with the exception of females when they are raising their young. The range of these big cats can be between 20km to 400km. Tigers in cold northern regions tend to have the largest territories. Scent marking allows tigers to communicate with other tigers in their range, and scratching posts are also useful communication tools, as well as helping to keep their claws sharp. Tigers have night vision that is six times better than that of humans, which helps them hunt successfully in the dark. A tiger will mainly hunt pigs and deer but is capable of taking prey larger than itself. The surviving tiger subspecies are the Siberian tiger, South China tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger, Malayan tiger and Bengal tiger. It is believed that between all of those subspecies, there are only 3,000 to 4,500 individuals left in the wild. The Javan tiger and Bali tiger are sadly both thought to have been hunted to extinction. They were most closely related to the Sumatran tiger (and may have even been the same subspecies), which is still clinging on in Indonesia. One of the saddest facts about tigers is that land development has led to around 96 per cent of the tiger’s natural range being lost in the past 100 years. Tigers are also being illegally hunted for their body parts such as bones, skin and teeth to fuel the growing demand for remedies made from tiger parts in Asia. As well as being illegally poached in the wild, tigers can still be legally farmed for their body parts in China. International trade in tiger parts is banned, but it’s a different story domestically, where there’s high demand for luxury rugs, tiger skin accessories, tiger bone wine and traditional medicines (which have never been shown to work).

 A   ( :  , 'a whole') is an   of   (or  )   and  , which awards   in various  . Universities typically provide   and  .
 The word   is derived from the    , which roughly means "community of teachers and scholars".  The modern university system has roots in the European  , which was created in Italy and evolved from   for the   during the  . 
 The original   word   refers in general to "a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild,  , etc".  At the time of the emergence of urban town life and    , specialized "associations of   and   with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located" came to be denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members. 
 In modern usage the word has come to mean  "  with the earlier emphasis on its corporate organization considered as applying historically to Medieval universities. 
 The original Latin word referred to degree-awarding institutions of learning in   and  , where this form of legal organisation was prevalent and from where the institution spread around the world.
 An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of  . The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the  , which adopted an academic charter, the  ,  in 1158 or 1155,  which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education. Today this is claimed as the origin of "academic freedom".  This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988, 430 university rectors signed the  ,  marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna's foundation. The number of universities signing the   continues to grow, drawing from all parts of the world.
 According to  , the earliest universities were founded in Asia and Africa, predating the first European  .  Scholars occassionally call the University of Al Quaraouiyine (name given in 1963), founded in Morocco by Fatima al-Fihri in 859, a university,  although Jacques Verger writes that this is done out of scholarly convenience.  Several scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin was founded  and run  as a   until after World War II. They date the transformation of the madrasa of al-Qarawiyyin into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.  In the wake of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed "University of Al Quaraouiyine" two years later. 
 Some scholars, including Makdisi, have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the madrasas in  , the  , and the Middle East during the  .  Norman Daniel, however, views this argument as overstated.  Roy Lowe and Yoshihito Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education, turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context. 
 The university is generally regarded as a formal institution that has its origin in the   tradition.  European higher education took place for hundreds of years in   or   ( ), in which   and   taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century.  The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the   by   as   and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception.  Later they were also founded by Kings ( ,  ,  ) or municipal administrations ( ,  ). In the  , most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by  .    was critical in promoting and regulating the concept of modern university as his   ordered the regulated establishment of cathedral schools that transformed themselves into the first European universities. 
 The first universities in Europe with a form of corporate/guild structure were the   (1088), the   (c.1150, later associated with the  ), and the   (1167).
 The University of Bologna began as a law school teaching the   or   of peoples which was in demand across Europe for those defending the right of incipient nations against empire and church. Bologna's special claim to   is based on its autonomy, its awarding of degrees, and other structural arrangements, making it the oldest continuously operating institution  independent of kings, emperors or any kind of direct religious authority. 
 The conventional date of 1088, or 1087 according to some,  records when   commences teaching   6th-century codification of Roman law, the  , recently discovered at Pisa. Lay students arrived in the city from many lands entering into a contract to gain this knowledge, organising themselves into 'Nationes', divided between that of the Cismontanes and that of the Ultramontanes. The students "had all the power … and dominated the masters". 
 In Europe, young men proceeded to university when they had completed their study of the  –the preparatory arts of  ,   and   or  –and the  :  ,  ,  , and  .
 All over Europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a European thirst for knowledge, and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions. Princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends. The emergence of humanism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts. 
 The rediscovery of  's works–more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated–fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century. Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history.  Richard Dales, for instance, calls the discovery of Aristotle's works "a turning point in the history of Western thought."  After Aristotle re-emerged, a community of scholars, primarily communicating in Latin, accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity, and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world, with those of the church. The efforts of this " " were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason. This became the primary mission of lecturers, and the expectation of students.
 The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south, although the northern (primarily Germany, France and  ) and southern universities (primarily Italy) did have many elements in common. Latin was the language of the university, used for all texts, lectures,   and examinations. Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic,  , and  ; while  ,  , and   were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology. There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception of degrees in theology, for which the doctorate was more common. Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates. The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions, while in the south students often went on to professional positions.  The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the  . Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna.  Among the southern universities, a further distinction has been noted between those of northern Italy, which followed the pattern of Bologna as a "self-regulating, independent corporation of scholars" and those of southern Italy and Iberia, which were "founded by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of government." 
 During the   (approximately late 15th century to 1800), the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth, productivity and innovative research. At the end of the Middle Ages, about 400 years after the first European university was founded, there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe. In the 15th century, twenty-eight new ones were created, with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625.  This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe, with the highest concentrations in the German Empire (34), Italian countries (26), France (25), and Spain (23) – this was close to a 500% increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages. This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared, or institutions that merged with other universities during this time.  The identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period, as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions. In fact, the term "university" was not always used to designate a higher education institution. In  , the term   was still often used, while "Academy" was common in Northern European countries. 
 The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the  , disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times.  ,  ,  ,  , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts.  This era was also affected by the rise of the  . As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state. 
 Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris, where student members are controlled by faculty "masters", provided a standard for universities, the application of this model took at least three different forms. There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum; this model tended to train specialists. There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at   where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature. There were also universities that combined these models, using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization. 
 Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages:  , logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, law, grammar and  . Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated.  Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the  . Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives.  Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts.  Professors of medicine such as  ,   and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts. The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship. For instance,   was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen, whose ideas he verified through his own dissections. In law, Andreas Alciatus infused the   with a humanist perspective, while   humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist.   cited the works of   as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts, which was important for the reform at Protestant universities.   , who taught at the Universities of   and  , and  , who taught at the   (as did Melanchthon), also had humanist training. The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs, syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship. 
 Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery, exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university, and the ideas of those texts into society generally, their influence was ultimately quite progressive. The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate (as the notable list of scholars above attests to). A focus on knowledge coming from self, from the human, has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction, and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities. This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts, but also their adaptation and expansion. For instance, Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen, but he also invigorated this text with experimentation, disagreements and further research.  The propagation of these texts, especially within the universities, was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular, which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices. 
 Examining the influence of humanism on scholars in medicine, mathematics, astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution. Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confines of the university, the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature of science during the  . Historians such as   have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists.  This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors, usually in princely courts, and associations with newly forming scientific societies. 
 Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science. In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the   were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts.  It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction.  Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities.  Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources. 
 Regardless of the way the tension between universities, individual scientists, and the scientific revolution itself is perceived, there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed. Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction, but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting. The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines. Instead of entering higher education to become a "general scholar" immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum, there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself. The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge. 
 The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities of research during this time, as individual scientists, associations and universities were vying for limited resources. There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public, or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities.  Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors, and the university provided foundational training and authority for the research and conclusions, they could not compete with the resources available through private benefactors. 
 By the end of the early modern period, the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context. Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging. The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture, and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state.
 By the 18th century, universities published their own   and by the 19th century, the German and the French university models had arisen. The German, or Humboldtian model, was conceived by   and based on  's liberal ideas pertaining to the importance of  ,  , and   in universities.  The French university model involved strict discipline and control over every aspect of the university.
 Until the 19th century,   played a significant role in university curriculum; however, the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century, and by the end of the 19th century, the German university model had spread around the world. Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses. In the United States, the   was the first to adopt the (German)   model; this pioneered the adoption by most other American universities.  In Britain, the move from   to   saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on   and  , a movement initiated in 1960 by Sir Keith Murray (chairman of the University Grants Committee) and  , with the formation of the  .  The British also established universities worldwide, and   became available to the masses not only in Europe.
 In 1963, the   on universities in the United Kingdom concluded that such institutions should have four main "objectives essential to any properly balanced system: instruction in skills; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women; to maintain research in balance with teaching, since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship." 
 In the early 21st century, concerns were raised over the increasing managerialisation and standardisation of universities worldwide. Neo-liberal management models have in this sense been critiqued for creating "corporate universities (where) power is transferred from faculty to managers, economic justifications dominate, and the familiar 'bottom line' eclipses pedagogical or intellectual concerns".  Academics' understanding of time, pedagogical pleasure, vocation, and collegiality have been cited as possible ways of alleviating such problems. 
 A   is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state. Some national universities are closely associated with national  ,   or   aspirations, for instance the  , which formed partly from the   which was created almost immediately and specifically in answer to the non-denominational universities which had been set up in Ireland in 1850. In the years leading up to the  , and in no small part a result of the Gaelic Romantic revivalists, the NUI collected a large amount of information on the   and  .  Reforms in Argentina were the result of the   of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic  higher education system.
 Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are  . An example is the  , which offers training in European law to lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics.   is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries, and the   engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the United Nations, its peoples and member states. The  , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences, is officially an intergovernmental organisation, set up by the member states of the  .
 Although each institution is organized differently, nearly all universities have a board of trustees; a president,  , or  ; at least one vice president, vice-chancellor, or vice-rector; and deans of various divisions. Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments, schools or  .   systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards . They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system. They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs. In addition, they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country. However, many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial, research and   autonomy.   are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies. However, they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances.
 The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world. In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state, while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay. In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town, while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world, and may provide university accommodation for their students. 
 The definition of a university varies widely, even within some countries.  Where there is clarification, it is usually set by a government agency.  For example:
 In Australia, the   (TEQSA) is Australia's independent national regulator of the higher education sector.  Students rights within university are also protected by the Education Services for Overseas Students Act (ESOS).
 In the United States there is no nationally standardized definition for the term  , although the term has traditionally been used to designate   and was once reserved for doctorate-granting research institutions.

 In India, a new designation   has been created for institutions of higher education that are not universities, but work at a very high standard in a specific area of study ("An Institution of Higher Education, other than universities, working at a very high standard in specific area of study, can be declared by the Central Government on the advice of the   as an Institution 'Deemed-to-be-university'"). Institutions that are 'deemed-to-be-university' enjoy the academic status and the privileges of a university.  Through this provision many schools that are commercial in nature and have been established just to exploit the demand for higher education have sprung up. 
 In Canada,   generally refers to a two-year, non-degree-granting institution, while   connotes a four-year, degree-granting institution. Universities may be sub-classified (as in the  ) into large research universities with many PhD-granting programs and medical schools (for example,  ); "comprehensive" universities that have some PhDs but are not geared toward research (such as  ); and smaller, primarily undergraduate universities (such as  ).
 In Germany, universities are institutions of higher education which have the power to confer bachelor, master and PhD degrees. They are explicitly recognised as such by law and cannot be founded without government approval. The term Universität (i.e. the German term for university) is protected by law and any use without official approval is a criminal offense. Most of them are public institutions, though a few private universities exist. Such universities are always research universities. Apart from these universities, Germany has other institutions of higher education (Hochschule,  ). Fachhochschule means a higher education institution which is similar to the former   in the British education system, the English term used for these German institutions is usually 'university of applied sciences'. They can confer master's degrees but no PhDs. They are similar to the model of   with less research and the research undertaken being highly practical. Hochschule can refer to various kinds of institutions, often specialised in a certain field (e.g. music, fine arts, business). They might or might not have the power to award PhD degrees, depending on the respective government legislation. If they award PhD degrees, their rank is considered equivalent to that of universities proper (Universität), if not, their rank is equivalent to universities of applied sciences.
 Colloquially, the term   may be used to describe a phase in one's life: "When I was at university..." (in the United States and Ireland,   is often used instead: "When I was in college..."). In Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the  ,   is often contracted to  . In Ghana, New Zealand, Bangladesh and in South Africa it is sometimes called "varsity" (although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years).  "Varsity" was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century.  "Varsity" is still in common usage in Scotland. 
 In many countries, students are required to pay tuition fees.
Many students look to get 'student grants' to cover the cost of university. In 2016, the average outstanding student loan balance per borrower in the United States was US$30,000.  In many U.S. states, costs are anticipated to rise for students as a result of decreased state funding given to public universities. 
 There are several major exceptions on tuition fees. In many European countries, it is possible to study without tuition fees. Public universities in   were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005. Denmark, Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students. Citizens of   and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees, and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact.  The situation in Germany is similar; public universities usually do not charge tuition fees apart from a small administrative fee. For degrees of a postgraduate professional level sometimes tuition fees are levied. Private universities, however, almost always charge tuition fees.
 The Quaraouiyine Mosque, founded in 859, is the most famous mosque of Morocco and attracted continuous investment by Muslim rulers. As for the nature of its curriculum, it was typical of other major madrasahs such as al-Azhar and Al Quaraouiyine, though many of the texts used at the institution came from Muslim Spain...Al Quaraouiyine began its life as a small mosque constructed in 859 C.E. by means of an endowment bequeathed by a wealthy woman of much piety, Fatima bint Muhammed al-Fahri. The Adjustments of Original Institutions of the Higher Learning: the Madrasah. Significantly, the institutional adjustments of the madrasahs affected both the structure and the content of these institutions. In terms of structure, the adjustments were twofold: the reorganization of the available original madaris and the creation of new institutions. This resulted in two different types of Islamic teaching institutions in al-Maghrib. The first type was derived from the fusion of old madaris with new universities. For example, Morocco transformed Al-Qarawiyin (859 A.D.) into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education in 1963. Higher education has always been an integral part of Morocco, going back to the ninth century when the Karaouine Mosque was established. The  , known today as Al Qayrawaniyan University, became part of the state university system in 1947. , in modern usage, the name of an institution of learning where the Islamic sciences are taught, i.e. a college for higher studies, as opposed to an elementary school of traditional type ( ); in mediaeval usage, essentially a college of   in which the other  , including literary and philosophical ones, were ancillary subjects only. A   is a college of  . The madrasa was an educational institution in which Islamic law ( ) was taught according to one or more   rites:  ,  ,  , or  . It was supported by an endowment or charitable trust ( ) that provided for at least one chair for one professor of law, income for other faculty or staff, scholarships for students, and funds for the maintenance of the building. Madrasas contained lodgings for the professor and some of his students. Subjects other than law were frequently taught in madrasas, and even   seances were held in them, but there could be no madrasa without law as technically the major subject. In studying an institution which is foreign and remote in point of time, as is the case of the medieval madrasa, one runs the double risk of attributing to it characteristics borrowed from one's own institutions and one's own times. Thus gratuitous transfers may be made from one culture to the other, and the time factor may be ignored or dismissed as being without significance. One cannot therefore be too careful in attempting a comparative study of these two institutions: the   and the  . But in spite of the pitfalls inherent in such a study, albeit sketchy, the results which may be obtained are well worth the risks involved. In any case, one cannot avoid making comparisons when certain unwarranted statements have already been made and seem to be currently accepted without question. The most unwarranted of these statements is the one which makes of the "madrasa" a "university".  is the oldest university in  . It was founded as a   in   in the middle of the ninth century. It has been a destination for students and scholars of   and Arabic studies throughout the history of Morocco. There were also other religious schools like the madras of ibn yusuf and other schools in the sus. This system of basic education called al-ta'lim al-aSil was funded by the sultans of Morocco and many famous traditional families. After independence, al-qarawiyin maintained its reputation, but it seemed important to transform it into a university that would prepare   for a modern country while maintaining an emphasis on Islamic studies. Hence, al-qarawiyin university was founded in February 1963 and, while the  's residence was kept in Fès, the new university initially had four   located in major regions of the country known for their religious influences and  . These colleges were kuliyat al-shari's in Fès, kuliyat uSul al-din in  , kuliyat al-lugha al-'arabiya in   (all founded in 1963), and kuliyat al-shari'a in Ait Melloul near  , which was founded in 1979.

A person walks past the University of Toronto campus during the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto on June 10, 2020.  Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press University of Toronto staff unions and the U of T Faculty Association (UTFA) are protesting the university’s plans for in-person classes in the fall, which contrast with other Ontario institutions that have chosen to teach the semester online. The groups fear U of T’s plans could compromise student, faculty and staff health and safety, and are calling for greater adoption of online education. Five U of T unions and the UTFA launched a petition called “U of T’s Reopening Plan is NOT Safe Enough. We Need to Take Fall 2020 Online.” As of Monday, its third day online, it had garnered more than 1,000 signatures. “We believe that in-person teaching is normally the most effective, valuable form of pedagogy; however, it cannot come at the cost of community safety,” the petition says. “Until the time that community safety can be ensured, we must perform whatever work we can remotely.” Story continues below advertisement Many major Canadian universities – including McGill, Queen’s and the University of Alberta – have chosen to hold their fall semesters online, with the exception of specific cases that require in-person interactions, such as labs. U of T’s recently released pandemic road map says “plans are being developed for a Fall term that mixes smaller, on-campus seminars, labs, and experiential learning with larger online and remote courses and lectures.” Individual U of T faculties are currently responsible for planning their fall semesters, said Terezia Zoric, president of the University of Toronto Faculty Association. Some, such as Applied Science and Engineering have committed to delivering all of their courses online, but the Faculty of Arts and Science and others are asking some professors to teach in a “dual-delivery” model. Under this model, classes will be split into online and in-person sections. The size of classes will be “set at the limit allowable according to physical distancing measurements for the assigned room,” a Faculty of Arts and Science memo to staff explained. Students must sit at least two metres apart and a video stream of professors’ lectures will be synchronously delivered to students who either chose remote learning or are unable to find room in class. The university’s media relations department said U of T will provide two non-medical masks “for every faculty, librarian, staff and student returning to campus.” On July 14, U of T president Meric Gertler sent a memo to the university community explaining that “at least one-third of our undergraduate courses will have an in-person component.” In some divisions, more than half of courses could include “an in-person option,” he wrote, adding that U of T anticipates “a higher proportion” of its graduate courses could be offered in person. The Faculty of Arts and Science has not told The Globe exactly how many of its professors will teach under the dual-delivery model, and how it has chosen which ones will do so. Story continues below advertisement “It’s not clear to me why we wouldn’t just go in the direction that basically every other university in Canada is going and just go fully online in the fall,” said Felan Parker, an assistant professor of book and media studies at the U of T’s St. Michael’s College. Prof. Parker is able to teach remotely in the fall, but is concerned for colleagues who might not have the option. The university’s media relations department said in an e-mailed statement that its “first priority remains the health and safety of our community,” adding that it anticipates the majority of its employees will keep working remotely into the fall. The statement also added that “approximately 90 per cent of [fall] undergraduate courses have an online option, and most of these courses will be online only.” U of T’s plans to allow some in-person teaching are causing tension as Stage 3 reopening is delayed in Toronto due to COVID-19 case counts and warnings of a second wave of the virus. “I’ve never had so many members contact the faculty association scared and upset as I do over this issue,” Ms. Zoric said. “They feel like they’re not being respected or listened to or protected.” She said many of her members, especially in the Faculty of Arts and Science, “will be teaching in person even though they don’t want to.” About 50 per cent of the university’s faculty is over age 50, she added. Dr. David Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the university’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, is concerned the university’s dual-delivery model ignores the risk of aerosol transmission of COVID-19. Professors and students in class would need to project their voices to be heard, he said, while custodian and cleaning staff would have to work in unsafe environments. Story continues below advertisement “The aerosols are probably where super spreader events happen,” Dr. Fisman said. “And super spreader events happen in closed, close and crowded settings like university dorms and classrooms.” Ms. Zoric and Dr. Fisman suggest U of T adopts plans similar to Ontario universities such as Queen’s and McMaster, which have gone mostly online. “U of T is located in the riskiest, most dangerous city in the country, but the university’s plan is the most ambitious and the most risky,” Ms. Zoric said. “It doesn’t make any sense.” The petition also said the unions, the UTFA  U of T’s 50 joint health and safety committees, and experts from U of T’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health had not been meaningfully consulted about fall plans. They asked for consultation and greater involvement. In an e-mailed statement, U of T’s media relations department said university officials “provided information to all joint health and safety committees regarding university re-entry planning.” The university also said in a previous letter that it had consulted with some experts from the school of public health.

A university differs from a college in that it is usually larger, has a broader curriculum, and offers graduate and professional degrees in addition to undergraduate degrees. Although universities did not arise in the West until the   in Europe, they existed in some parts of Asia and Africa in ancient times. The modern Western university evolved from the   schools known as  ; they were generally recognized places of study open to students from all parts of  . The earliest   arose out of efforts to educate clerks and   beyond the level of the cathedral and   schools. The inclusion of scholars from foreign countries   the primary difference between the   and the schools from which they grew. The earliest Western institution that can be called a university was a famous medical school that arose at  ,  , in the 9th century and drew students from all over Europe. It remained merely a medical school, however. The first true university in the West was founded at   late in the 11th century. It became a widely respected school of   and  . The first university to arise in northern Europe was the  , founded between 1150 and 1170. It became noted for its   of  , and it served as a model for other universities in northern Europe such as the   in England, which was well established by the end of the 12th century. The Universities of Paris and Oxford were composed of colleges, which were actually endowed   halls for scholars. These early universities were corporations of students and masters, and they eventually received their charters from  ,  , and  . The  , founded by Emperor   (1224), was the first to be established under imperial authority, while the University of Toulouse, founded by Pope   (1229), was the first to be established by papal decree. These universities were free to govern themselves, provided they taught neither   nor  . Students and masters together elected their own rectors (presidents). As the   of independence, however, universities had to   themselves. So teachers charged fees, and, to assure themselves of a livelihood, they had to please their students. These early universities had no permanent buildings and little corporate  , and they were subject to the loss of dissatisfied students and masters who could migrate to another   and establish a place of study there. The history of the   began in 1209 when a number of disaffected students moved there from Oxford, and 20 years later Oxford profited by a migration of students from the University of Paris. From the 13th century on, universities were established in many of the principal cities of Europe. Universities were founded at Montpellier (beginning of the 13th century) and Aix-en-Provence (1409) in  , at   (1222),   (1303), and   (1321) in Italy, at   (1218) in  , at Prague (1348) and   (1365) in central Europe, at   (1386),   (1409), Freiburg (1457), and   (1477) in what is now  , at Louvain (1425) in present-day  , and at   (1411) and   (1451) in Scotland. Until the end of the 18th century, most Western universities offered a core curriculum based on the seven liberal arts:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Students then proceeded to study under one of the professional faculties of  ,  , and theology. Final examinations were grueling, and many students failed. The     of the 16th century and the ensuing   affected the universities of Europe in different ways. In the German states, new Protestant universities were founded and older schools were taken over by Protestants, while many   universities became staunch defenders of the traditional   associated with the Catholic church. By the 17th century, both Protestant and Catholic universities had become overly devoted to defending correct   and hence remained resistant to the new interest in   that had begun to sweep through Europe. The new learning was discouraged, and thus many universities underwent a period of relative decline. New schools continued to be founded during this time, however, including ones at Edinburgh (1583), Leiden (1575), and Strasbourg (university status, 1621). The first modern university in Europe was that of  , founded by   in 1694. This school was one of the first to renounce religious orthodoxy of any kind in favour of rational and objective   inquiry, and it was the first where teachers lectured in   (i.e., a   language) rather than in  .

There continues to be evidence of community transmission of COVID-19 in Durham Region. This means that the virus is spreading in the community and is not necessarily linked to travel or other known cases.   Durham Region Health Department has created this dashboard to present updated information about COVID-19 cases in Durham Region. We show the number of confirmed cases by status, municipality, age and gender. The COVID-19 Data Tracker also displays the number of new cases and cumulative cases by reported date and onset date. This information will help us to see whether we are "flattening the curve". These data are extracted daily from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) at 1 p.m. The numbers may differ from other sources such as Public Health Ontario, as data may be extracted at different times. The COVID-19 Data Tracker was created with the assistance of the Region of Durham’s Corporate Services – Information Technology Division and the Data, Mapping & Graphics Group within the Planning & Economic Development Department. The use of non-medical masks or face coverings in all enclosed (indoor) public spaces is an additional public health measure (along with physical distancing, hand and cough hygiene, and staying home when sick) that may prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the community. Wearing a non-medical mask when in public or other settings is not a replacement for following proven measures such as handwashing and  . As of 12:01 p.m. Tuesday July 28, 2020, wearing non-medical masks or face coverings will be required in all enclosed (indoor) public spaces in Durham Region. Enclosed public spaces are indoor public spaces of businesses or organizations accessed by the public, where the public interact with each other and with staff. The areas of all enclosed (indoor) public spaces that are subject to the non-medical mask and face covering requirements are:  issued on July 28 and  . A person is exempt from wearing a non-medical mask or face covering on the premises if: Does a person have to show proof of their exemption? No, a person does not have to show proof of their exemption. There is no need for an exemption card, or a letter from a physician. To choose a non-medical mask or face covering, ensure: Other options for non-medical masks include wearing a bandana or scarf, or making one out of a T-shirt or a bandana. Durham Region Transit passengers are required to wear a face covering or non-medical mask at all times during their travels on public transit, except for those that have exemptions. Please visit   for the full list of passenger requirements to protect yourself and others while using public transit. Signage for all enclosed (indoor) public spaces: Today, I issued   to expand the use of mandatory face coverings to all indoor, enclosed public spaces throughout Durham Region. These instructions are an extension of the directions provided on July 6 and are issued to help with efforts to decrease the spread of COVID-19 in the community. Although many members of our community are currently wearing face coverings as outlined in my instructions from July 6, there continues to be a risk for increased cases of COVID-19 in the community during Stage 3. Mandatory face coverings in indoor, enclosed public spaces during Stage 3 will help us to continue to reduce the risk of increased spread of illness and aligns with other regions and municipalities, and other public health units. Indoor, enclosed public spaces include any spaces open to the public where the public interact with each other and with staff of these establishments. These spaces include places where goods and services are sold, municipal facilities, including libraries, indoor attractions, event spaces, indoor entertainment facilities, athletic facilities, dining establishments, and private transportation services. Some establishments have separate guidelines and regulations and are not included in these instructions, such as schools, childcare centres, day camps, places of worship, hospitals, offices not open to members of the public, and outdoor spaces. The Health Department will focus enforcement activities on educating community members about the mandatory requirements for non-medical masks or face coverings. Business operators should make every effort to remind customers to wear a face covering, but also be mindful that some in our community may be unable to wear a face covering for very valid reasons. I ask all area residents and business operators to be respectful, work together and recognize that some people may be exempt from wearing a face covering for various reasons including health concerns, age or religious reasons. Business operators should not deny access to goods or services if a face covering cannot be worn, and no person is required to provide proof of exemption. Please remember to continue to practise physical distancing wherever possible even when wearing a face covering, and refer to Health Department resources on  ,  , and  . July 23, 2020 On July 24, Durham Region can move into Stage 3 of the provincial government’s  . The province’s decision was made in consultation with Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health and was based on results of key public health indicators. In Stage 3, almost all businesses and public spaces can reopen with public health measures in place to protect staff and the public. Certain high-risk places and activities may not open during Stage 3 due to the likelihood of large crowds congregating, difficulties with physical distancing, or challenges maintaining the proper cleaning and sanitation required to prevent the spread of COVID-19. A complete list of places that can and cannot open in Stage 3 is available in  . Gatherings are limited to a maximum of 50 people indoors and a maximum of 100 people outdoors. While gathering limits will be increased and residents will be able to get back to most regular activities, everyone must continue to follow public health advice, practise physical distancing and limit close contact to members of their   of no more than 10 people. Public health measures that residents can take to protect themselves and others (e.g. proper hand hygiene, staying home if feeling unwell, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces often, avoid touching one’s face, etc.) have not changed and are recommended to reduce the spread of germs. Please refer to Health Department resources on   for actions you can continue to take to reduce the spread of COVID-19. With everyone’s commitment and cooperation, we have seen progress across Durham Region and a decrease in the number of new cases of COVID-19. In Stage 3, we will need the continued commitment of all area residents to maintain these gains and prevent an increase in the spread of illness.  July 15, 2020 Currently, Durham Region is in Stage 2 of the government’s reopening framework and we may receive communication about movement to Stage 3 in the coming weeks. During Stage 2, we have seen many local businesses and workplaces reopen including restaurant patios, recreational water facilities, some personal service settings, malls and other area services. As the Region continues to reopen, we must all remember that the risk for the ongoing spread of illness remains. Area residents are asked to continue following public health advice to prevent a potential increase in COVID-19 spread in our community. The Health Department’s COVID-19 web page provides numerous resources that can help residents understand the status of COVID-19 activity in our Region, and the preventative measures that they can take to keep themselves and others safe. Residents can find: information about COVID-19 testing and accessing test results; up to date information on COVID-19 cases in Durham Region through the Durham Region COVID-19 Data Tracker; a comprehensive Community Reopening Toolkit that includes guidance to residents and businesses to prepare for the safe reopening of our community; Section 22 class orders and special instructions that I have issued; information about non-medical masks and face coverings, and resources to help residents choose, make and use non-medical masks; up to date information about travel; and, additional facts about COVID-19. Through the various stages of reopening, please continue to stay informed, practise physical distancing, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, and wear a non-medical mask or face covering in commercial establishments. Please visit   regularly for the latest information, resources and tools so you can stay safe while getting back to your normal activities and routines. July 9, 2020 During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Durham Region Health Department had to close clinics and suspend many regular programs and services to ensure our capacity to respond to COVID-19, comply with provincial direction and ensure public safety. Now that the number of new cases of COVID-19 has been decreasing across the Region, the Health Department can begin to restore priority programs and services with protective measures in place to ensure the safety of clients and staff. The Health Department is pleased to advise residents that we are gradually restoring our clinical services. Clinical programs began to see clients on July 6 and we will slowly be increasing availability and the range of services throughout the summer. Services are now being provided at the Breastfeeding, Oral Health and Sexual Health clinics. Residents can call Durham Health Connection Line at 1-800-841-2729 to make an appointment. Currently, all clinic visits are by appointment only and walk-in patients will not be accepted at any location to help control the spread of COVID-19. Clients will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms, assessed regarding their appointment needs, and will be required to wear a non-medical mask or face covering to all in-person clinic appointments. Our Infant and Child Development program will be providing virtual care to clients and the Immunization program will provide appointments for priority clients. The Health Department is also working hard to ensure delivery of priority health protection programs. West Nile virus surveillance activities began at the beginning of June and   are provided on durham.ca. Public health inspectors have also been investigating all animal bites and scratches to prevent the spread of rabies to residents. The Health Department has completed 670 rabies investigations, so far this year. Public health inspections are also still focused on ensuring that required preventative measures to safeguard against COVID-19 have been implemented. As the Health Department begins to restore its programs and services, COVID-19 will continue to be a public health priority. We will continue to review new information, assess the risks to the public and will adjust our restoration plans as required. July 7, 2020 While cases of COVID-19 are currently decreasing in Durham Region, the risk for the ongoing spread of illness remains as the Region continues to re-open. That is why I have issued   to commercial establishments, currently permitted to operate under the  ,  , to have a policy in place to prohibit people not wearing a non-medical mask or face covering from entering or remaining in the premises. The use of non-medical masks or face coverings in commercial establishments is an additional public health measure (along with physical distancing, hand and cough hygiene, and staying home when sick) that may prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the community. Non-medical masks or face coverings will be required in commercial establishments currently operating during Stage 2, while the provincial Emergency Orders remain in force. The Health Department will be taking a progressive enforcement approach to ensure compliance, with a focus on education. Residents can support local businesses by paying attention to signage and following instructions at commercial establishments. Both individuals and businesses who do not comply with the requirements may be fined. Please refer to the   for details on the commercial establishments included in the instructions, establishments that are excluded, and people that are exempt from wearing a non-medical mask or face covering in commercial establishments. A number of tools and resources have been developed to support commercial establishments and help residents to comply with requirements, including  ,   and  . Please continue to be vigilant and follow public health advice as we continue to fight the spread of COVID-19 in our community. July 2, 2020 Across the province, there has been an increasing number of COVID-19 outbreaks at agricultural workplaces employing temporary foreign workers (TFWs). TFWs play a vital role in our agricultural industry and provide essential support to local farm owners/operators. As TFWs may be living in shared seasonal accommodations with limited opportunity for physical distancing, they can be at increased risk of illness from COVID-19. On June 24, I issued a  , under the authority of the  , that will strengthen our ability to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of our essential food sector workers. The class order is a legal tool to help ensure that agricultural farm owners/operators and staff comply with the directions set out in the order. Farm owners/operators who employ TFWs are required to implement public health measures and take actions listed in the order to minimize the risks to health for those they employ. In addition to the class order, Region of Durham Paramedic Services has been working hard to collect swabs for testing from TFWs to support our surveillance testing efforts. The surveillance testing will help to proactively prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the temporary foreign worker and agricultural worker populations. Detailed   have also been developed to provide information to farm owners/operators and TFWs about precautions they should take in response to COVID-19. The Health Department is continuing to fight the spread of COVID-19 across Durham Region and is working to help protect vulnerable populations in our community. June 30, 2020 The Health Department has implemented a number of enhancements to the   to help inform residents of the status of COVID-19 in Durham Region. In addition to information about case status, institutional outbreaks, trends and exposure source, residents can view cases according to Health Neighbourhoods. Users can filter an interactive map by a particular Health Neighbourhood to see the total number of cases and the cases per 100,000 population for the neighbourhood. The Data Tracker now also features   to show how well Durham Region is doing in terms of virus spread and containment, health system capacity, public health capacity, and laboratory testing for COVID-19. The indicators were chosen by Ontario public health units as core indicators for local monitoring to help inform reopening decisions. For each of the indicators, users can see if Durham Region is meeting the goal, approaching the goal, or does not meet the goal. Details on the definition of each indicator are available in the Technical Notes on the Data Tracker. The monitoring indicators are updated every Wednesday, whereas the other data reported on the Data Tracker continue to be updated daily. The data are continuously reviewed and discussed with community partners to help inform local planning. Please continue to visit   regularly for the latest information, resources and tools to help keep yourself and your family safe as the province begins to reopen. June 25, 2020 With the arrival of summer and the opening of local public beaches, it is understandable that area residents will want to spend time enjoying the water. While current research shows that the risk of COVID-19 transmission from recreational waters is very low, we know that COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when in close contact with others. In public spaces, including while swimming, playing and relaxing at the beach, it is very important for residents to practise physical distancing and stay at least two metres (six feet) away from anyone outside of their household or  . Residents are less likely to be exposed to COVID-19 if physical distancing is maintained while in the water and on the shore. Before heading to the beach, ensure that you are prepared: check the  ;   to check for any COVID-19 symptoms; pack alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60 per cent alcohol) and disinfectant wipes to be used during your beach visit; and, consider taking a bag with you to easily and quickly dispose of your garbage. Please follow instructions and respect signage at the beach. Changes will be implemented to protect beachgoers and facilitate physical distancing and proper hand hygiene where possible. For more information, refer to the Health Department’s  . Please stay home if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or you have been in close contact with anyone who has been sick with the virus. We encourage area residents to enjoy outdoor activities while using personal protective measures and staying safe. June 23, 2020 While it may appear that things are beginning to get back to normal within Durham Region, we must continue to remind ourselves that our fight is not over. Due to everyone’s collective efforts and taking actions like practising physical distancing, wearing a mask when physical distancing is a challenge, frequent handwashing, staying at home when feeling unwell, and keeping high touch surfaces clean, we have seen a decrease in the number of new COVID-19 cases across Durham Region. As more area businesses and services reopen and a greater number of residents are out within the community, it is more important than ever to continue to take actions to  .   and   continue to be some of the most effective strategies to protect yourselves and others.  At this time, people in Durham Region are also strongly encouraged to wear a non-medical mask or face covering if physical distancing is not possible. Please refer to Health Department resources for   and  . The Health Department continues to evaluate the latest evidence and considers all options, based on provincial information and the local context to provide area residents with public health advice that will help keep everyone safe. June 18, 2020 The province announced that Durham Region can move to Stage 2 of the government’s reopening framework on June 19. Stage 2 allows for the reopening of many businesses and workplaces including restaurant patios, recreational water facilities, some personal service settings, malls and other area services. A complete list of businesses and facilities that can open is available at  . Dates and approaches to reopening may vary based on our community’s local needs and the ability of each business or service to meet workplace safety guidelines and public health advice. Clients and consumers will see many changes in the way services are provided. Local businesses will depend on the continued support and cooperation of their clients to ensure everyone’s safety. The Health Department has compiled information in a   intended to provide guidance to residents and businesses to prepare for the safe reopening of our community. All area residents and businesses are encouraged to review the information in the Toolkit to familiarize themselves with actions they can take to protect themselves, their clients and their staff. It is important to remember that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and community spread is still occurring. If you have any symptoms or if you have been in close contact with someone who is sick or has COVID-19 in the past 14 days, or if you have returned from travel outside of Canada,  , go home, self-isolate and consult   to determine next steps. Please continue to practise physical distancing, wear a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. June 16, 2020 Practising physical distancing continues to be a key strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our community. Thank you to all area residents and community partners that have been working hard to follow public health advice to help keep community members healthy and safe. Everyone’s cooperative efforts have helped us to move past the peak of COVID-19 infection in Durham Region. Now that we are beginning to see a decrease in the number of new cases reported in our Region, we can broaden the number of individuals with whom we maintain close contact. The provincial government is encouraging people throughout Ontario to establish a social circle of no more than 10 people who can interact and come into close contact with one another without physical distancing. This means that residents may be able to hug, touch and be close with family and friends outside their immediate household, which will support the mental health and well-being of all residents. The provincial government has developed a   during COVID-19. If someone in the social circle begins to feel unwell, the individual must immediately self-isolate and should inform other members of the circle. Everyone else in the circle should closely monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19. Individuals that may have been exposed to COVID-19 can arrange to get tested by completing the  . Please stay informed, be vigilant and follow public health advice as we continue to fight the spread of COVID-19. June 11, 2020 As the provincial government gradually begins to ease restrictions, Durham Region residents will need to continue to be vigilant and take protective public health measures to prevent themselves and others from becoming ill. To continue to closely monitor the spread of COVID-19, the provincial government released an expanded testing plan which includes: asymptomatic, risk-based testing; targeted testing for vulnerable populations; and, ongoing testing to respond to and manage outbreaks. Testing and contact tracing help us to understand transmission, identify trends and monitor the spread of COVID-19. Residents who are symptomatic (people with at least one symptom of COVID-19, even mild and atypical symptoms), residents who are asymptomatic (people with no symptoms but who are concerned that they have been exposed to COVID-19) and individuals who are at risk of exposure in their workplace, can get tested. Testing for COVID-19 is through an upper respiratory tract specimen (nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab and/or viral throat swab) to test for the presence of the virus. Residents who would like to be tested for COVID-19 must complete the  . Once the form is submitted, the Assessment Centre will respond and provide further instructions. The Assessment Centre does not accept walk-in clients. It is always important to remember that a test will only provide a point-in-time result. Residents exposed to COVID-19 following a negative test may develop symptoms and may need to be tested again. If you have been tested and you develop symptoms at a later time, you must immediately self-isolate to prevent others from becoming ill. All residents, even those with negative test results, must continue to practise physical distancing, wash their hands often and take additional public health precautions, such as using a face covering (non-medical mask) when physical distancing may not be possible, to keep themselves, their families, colleagues and community members healthy and safe. June 9, 2020 Residents living in retirement homes and other congregate living settings, such as group homes and shelters, are some of the most vulnerable in our community. We know that older adults are at greater risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and physical distancing may be challenging for those living in group settings and using shared spaces. The Health Department is working hard to minimize the risks of COVID-19 by taking extra steps to facilitate testing, on a volunteer basis, for residents and staff of these homes. The purpose of surveillance testing is to learn more about the spread of COVID-19, especially asymptomatic infection, in the community. This information provides a point-in-time picture of COVID-19 and can help inform timely strategies to prevent the spread of illness. With the help of Region of Durham Paramedic Services, and the support of our local partners including group homes, retirement homes, shelters and our Social Services colleagues, 3,140 swabs for testing have been collected from residents and staff, as of June 8. In addition, thanks to the collaborative efforts of our administrative services staff, paramedics, public health inspectors and public health nurses who are working hard to organize and monitor testing, we have successfully completed surveillance activities at over 50 facilities. We hope that the enhanced surveillance testing will help to protect vulnerable populations in our community. June 4, 2020 While some restrictions are slowly being lifted and more businesses and services are identifying ways to reopen safely, the work of the Health Department continues to be focused on COVID-19. We are now seeing that there is an overall decrease of new cases reported in the community, but we did see a small increase over the past week and data show that community spread is still occurring. That’s why our focus continues to be on preventing the spread of COVID-19 in our community. Staff remains committed to providing support across Durham Region to ensure that all sectors and residents have the information they need to continue to protect themselves and their families. Over the past few weeks, the Health Department has implemented: enhanced surveillance testing and has supported testing of all staff and residents in long-term care homes and staff in emergency childcare centres; Region of Durham Paramedic Services is obtaining nasal swabs from retirement homes and other congregate settings; a new Community Reopening Toolkit was launched on May 29; there have been a number of enhancements to the Durham Region COVID-19 Data Tracker, including detailed information on institutional outbreaks and cases reported by exposure source; and, staff continues to focus on case and contact management and consistently exceeds the provincial target of contacting 90 per cent of newly identified cases within 24 hours. The   which highlights some of the Health Department’s COVID-19 response activities and achievements to date has been updated. While we are working on a plan for restoring Health Department programs and services, COVID-19 will continue to be a priority. We remain committed to protecting the health and safety of area residents and will continue to keep our community informed of public health measures that will help to further decrease the number of new cases of COVID-19 in Durham Region. June 2, 2020 The provincial government continues to ease restrictions and more businesses and services are opening in Durham Region. As businesses and services begin to reopen, every precaution should be taken to ensure the health and safety of the community and help prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Health Department has launched a new online resource to provide businesses and the community with information on the various stages of reopening of services as announced by the provincial government. The Community Reopening Toolkit is designed to help users navigate through resources from numerous organizations that are providing information to help with the requirements of reopening businesses and services. Information in the Community Reopening Toolkit includes links to resources from a variety of industry agencies and numerous guidance documents for sector-specific businesses and services. The Health Department has also created downloadable resources – such as signage and flyers – which can be used by businesses and services to help them plan and understand the requirements for reopening services and amenities. The toolkit will be constantly updated as new openings and phases are announced and obsolete information will be removed. To access the Community Reopening Toolkit, visit  . May 29, 2020 Our advice to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in our community continues to be to stay home as much as possible and practice physical distancing. Thank you to everyone who is doing their part and only going out when necessary. You are helping us to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in Durham Region. At the same time, residents should also pay attention to their health and any symptoms that require urgent attention. Residents should always call 911 if they are in medical distress and need urgent care. Emergency departments, paramedics and 911 services are continuing to respond to medical emergencies. The Region of Durham Paramedic Services has implemented numerous measures to ensure the safety of patients who require transport to hospital, as well as the paramedics providing care. Local hospitals have also taken precautions and implemented changes to ensure the safety of patients such as frequent cleaning, staff wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), frequent hand-washing, separate care areas for patients with COVID-19 and screening at emergency room entrances. Some of the signs that may indicate a medical emergency include: unconsciousness, lack of breathing, or lack of pulse; chest pain or discomfort; severe pain; shortness of breath or dizziness; choking; broken bones; severe bleeding; trouble seeing or speaking; sudden, severe headaches; and sudden weakness, numbness, or tingling in the face, arms or legs. If you are in medical distress and need urgent care and have symptoms of COVID-19, call 911 and let the operator know that you may have COVID-19. This will ensure that paramedics arriving on scene can take appropriate precautions. For more information on when to call 911, please visit the Emergency Services web page on  . May 28, 2020 This week, May 25-29, is Privacy Awareness Week. This is a global effort to promote awareness of privacy issues and the importance of the protection of personal information. This year’s Privacy Awareness Week arrived during both uncertain and unprecedented times. Durham Region Health Department, much like many health care providers around the world, is learning to adapt and respond to the very serious challenges presented by COVID-19. As circumstances are changing rapidly, the demand for timely and relevant information requires that we adjust to new ways of operating. We understand that personal health information needs to be shared to prevent and manage COVID-19, and that public health concerns are front of mind in this current pandemic. The Health Department is also aware of its role in supporting public trust and confidence in the handling of such information, and our Health Information, Privacy and Security (HIPS) team work very hard to maintain that public trust and confidence. In taking steps to manage the pandemic, the Health Department has implemented information handling practices to: On-going and annual training and awareness in privacy and information security for all Health Department staff helps keep us abreast of developments in appropriate safeguards, and equips us with the information we need to confidently and correctly handle personal health information. This is all very important work of the HIPS team as they continue to ensure the protection and care of our community’s personal health information. May 25, 2020 This week, May 24-30, is National Paramedic Services Week and I acknowledge the hard work, support and selfless dedication of the paramedics in the Region of Durham Paramedic Services (RDPS). The theme for this year is Pandemic: Paramedics on the Front Line – a truly appropriate message as it demonstrates the important role that paramedics play as part of the first response team of the healthcare system during a pandemic. RDPS is made up of more than 330 advanced care and primary care paramedics serving the residents of Durham Region and surrounding area, responding to over 145,000 calls for service every year. The members of this highly skilled team are often the first on the scene providing care and support in very challenging conditions, and COVID-19 has dramatically affected the way paramedics keep themselves and the public safe and healthy. Throughout this pandemic, RDPS has played an integral role in providing assistance and working with Health Department staff to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. In addition to responding to ongoing emergency requests for service throughout our community, RDPS provided invaluable support to the Health Department’s COVID-19 response by collecting over 1,060 nasal swabs for testing from long-term care residents and staff, as part of the provincial surveillance initiative to get a point-in-time picture of COVID-19 in these facilities. COVID-19 has also created added strain on paramedic services, as paramedics need to be careful not to expose themselves to the virus and risk spreading it to others in the community. This means wearing numerous kinds of personal protective equipment (PPE) several times per shift, which is necessary to protect both paramedics and members of our community. In addition, the diligent work of the logistics and operational support staff, who work behind the scenes everyday, is imperative to ensure our paramedics are able to provide the best service to the residents of Durham Region. As key members of first responders, all members of RDPS play a vital role in the response to COVID-19 and I thank them all for their ongoing commitment to our community during these challenging times. May 21, 2020 On May 13, the case definition for COVID-19 was updated to include multisystem inflammatory vasculitis as an atypical presentation in children. This inflammatory illness has recently been reported in a small number of children worldwide in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the symptoms associated with this illness include persistent fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), as well as rash. This multisystem inflammatory vasculitis has symptoms that may also occur in Kawasaki disease (an illness that causes inflammation of the arteries). Parents should contact their health care providers if their children experience these symptoms. Residents may have also heard of COVID toes in the media, which refers to skin findings observed in some individuals with COVID-19, characterized by swollen, painful and/or itchy lesions on the feet, toes and fingers. At this time, the Ontario Ministry of Health guidance has not identified COVID toes as an atypical symptom in children. If you have concerns about your child’s health, contact your health care provider. Please continue to follow public health advice to protect yourself and your children from COVID-19. Continue to practice physical distancing, wash your hands often with soap and water, avoid touching your face and keep surfaces clean and disinfected. If you experience symptoms, please stay home and if your symptoms worsen, seek clinical assessment by either completing an online self-assessment, or contacting Durham Health Connection Line, Telehealth Ontario or your health care provider. We are committed to sharing up to date information and advice to help keep residents healthy and safe. Please continue to visit   for resources and tools relevant to our community, and follow us on   and   for the latest updates. May 19, 2020 The Central Lake Ontario Conservation Authority (CLOCA), one of Durham Region’s community partners, will re-open conservation areas on May 20. CLOCA has many beautiful conservation areas throughout Durham Region to enjoy, and it is very important for our health and well-being to remain active, get outdoors and appreciate nature. While this is good news for area residents, the risk of COVID-19 spread remains in the community. We ask that visitors follow physical distancing guidelines and use personal protective measures to protect themselves and others from becoming ill. We remind all visitors to: not gather in groups and avoid crowded places; limit close contact with individuals outside your household, both in indoor and outdoor spaces; stay at least two metres (six feet) away from other people; greet others from a distance with a wave or a nod; pay attention to physical barriers in place to ensure physical distancing; avoid touching your face; keep hand sanitizer with you so you can clean your hands often; cover your sneeze with a tissue and immediately throw the tissue in the garbage, practice hand hygiene and if you do not have a tissue, sneeze into your sleeve or arm; use contactless payment systems and avoid handling money as much as possible; and wash your hands with soap and water at the first opportunity. Please remember to stay home if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or you have been in close contact with anyone who has been sick with the virus. As the government continues to ease restrictions, residents should stay informed by visiting  , often and referring to the most current and credible public health information and recommendations available from the  ,  ,   and  . May 15, 2020 The provincial government has begun to ease restrictions on businesses in a staged approach. Residents will be able to visit additional seasonal, retail and household businesses, as well as participate in some seasonal services and activities. Please visit the   for the most up to date information. While this is good news for both residents and business owners, it is critical that we all continue to maintain physical distancing, wash our hands frequently, clean high-touch surfaces often, and follow instructions when accessing services. As businesses begin to re-open, residents will see many changes in the way that services are provided, such as minimized use of cash transactions, needing to make appointments for service or pick-up, and being asked to remain in one’s car for curbside pick-up transactions. Since there is still a risk of COVID-19 spread in the community, these changes are crucial to maintain the health and safety of employees and clients. The Health Department is committed to supporting local businesses by providing advice on measures they can implement to operate in a safe way. If we all work together and support each other during this transition period, then we will all be able to get back to our normal routines and the activities we enjoy sooner. Please continue to stay informed, follow instructions and stay home when possible, so we can decrease the number of new COVID-19 cases in our community. May 13, 2020 The Health Department’s COVID-19 response to reduce the spread of illness and protect the health and safety of area residents is a true team effort. Our response has benefited from the expertise of administrative support staff, epidemiologists, nurses, paramedics and public health inspectors. Our administrative support staff has been instrumental in helping to manage resources, monitor inventory and distribute equipment and supplies. The team has assembled more than 4,700 testing kits for use by community partners. The epidemiologists have developed the informative and interactive   to provide residents with detailed information on the status of COVID-19 in our community. Our nurses have been working hard to respond to all inquiries, support residents that have tested positive for COVID-19 and follow contacts of confirmed cases. In addition to responding to ongoing emergency requests for service throughout our community, Region of Durham Paramedic Services has provided significant support to the COVID-19 response by obtaining nasal swabs for testing from area residents, emergency child care centre staff and long-term care residents and staff. Our public health inspectors have been essential in managing outbreaks in facilities and conducting investigations to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. While most of our staff in Oral Health and Infant and Child Development has not been working in their regular program areas, their assistance has been essential as they have been redeployed to provide much needed support with work on COVID-19. Our talented Community and Resource Development team that works very hard to keep residents informed every day, has prepared an   which highlights some of the Health Department’s COVID-19 response activities and achievements to date. Every Health Department staff member has a vital role in helping to keep residents informed, healthy and safe, and I am very appreciative of their hard work and enduring commitment. May 12, 2020 Today on International Nurses Day, I acknowledge the unwavering commitment, highly effective collaboration, expertise and care demonstrated throughout the COVID-19 response by our nurses who work in public health. As the need for resources to address COVID-19 grew, our nurses across all programs immediately responded. They changed their schedules, shifted gears, received training and jumped in to provide support to residents and local partners. The Health Department has a team of highly skilled nurses who have been working with their colleagues to keep residents and local stakeholders informed, support residents who are ill and protect those at risk of becoming ill. Over the past three months, our nurses have completed more than 48,000 phone interactions with residents and community partners, managed more than 1,100 COVID-19 cases, followed almost 2,200 contacts of confirmed cases of COVID-19, and completed more than 14,000 nursing assessments to determine if further medical intervention is required. Our nurses are excellent listeners and skilled problem-solvers who work to understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by area residents. Our nurses also work collaboratively with colleagues across the Health Department to ensure a coordinated response utilizing the experience, expertise and skills of our diverse staff. As key members of the Health Department team, our nurses have played a vital role in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we will continue to rely on them to help us through this challenging time. May 7, 2020 The spread of COVID-19 in the Region’s long-term care homes continues to be a very serious concern and we have been working with our long-term care partners to implement outbreak control measures to prevent further illness. In addition to measures already implemented to help reduce the risks for long-term care residents and staff, the Health Department and local partners have mobilized resources to conduct surveillance testing for all staff and residents in long-term care homes, and staff in emergency child care centres by May 15, in accordance with provincial direction. The enhanced surveillance testing will help to further understand the spread of COVID-19 in long-term care homes and will help to proactively prevent the spread of COVID-19 in local emergency child care centres. This significant undertaking involves a collaborative approach which can only be achieved with the efforts and support of our local partners including long-term care homes, child care centres, Lakeridge Health, and our Social Services colleagues. I am thankful for an excellent team of administrative services staff, public health inspectors and public health nurses who are working tirelessly to organize and monitor testing at these facilities, and I am grateful for the highly skilled paramedics that are supporting COVID-19 response activities and conducting testing where needed. Thanks to the support of our local partners and coordinated efforts of everyone, we anticipate that our surveillance activities will be completed within the provincial timeline and we hope that the enhanced surveillance testing will help to protect vulnerable populations in our community. May 5, 2020 On April 25, the Ontario government announced that community and allotment gardens can be used across the province. This announcement recognizes that these gardens are an essential source of fresh food for individuals and families, including those who face food insecurity. Any person who uses community and allotment gardens in Durham Region must do so in compliance with the advice, recommendations and instructions of the Health Department. We are very supportive of these invaluable community initiatives and we are working closely with our community partners, such as the Durham Integrated Growers for a Sustainable Community (DIG), to provide advice, instructions and recommendations regarding the safe use of community and allotment gardens to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the community. Please refer to the Health Department’s guidance document   for residents and community partners, and follow instructions to use and operate these gardens in a safe manner. May 1, 2020 The Health Department has been actively involved in COVID-19 response activities since before the first case was confirmed in Canada. Staff was monitoring the global situation very closely in order to prepare for the potential emergence of COVID-19 in Durham Region. As COVID-19 began to spread rapidly across the globe, the Health Department mobilized its resources and began implementing measures identified in the Health Department Emergency Master Plan. Some of the Health Department’s pandemic response activities include: assessment and surveillance; case management and contact tracing; communication; development and implementation of new policies and procedures; documentation and reporting; facilitating testing; and, response to inquiries. Throughout the pandemic, we have ensured ongoing collaboration with local community partners. We are thankful for the support from our community partners who have helped us to coordinate activities and resources to keep residents safe and informed. Using the latest evidence and recommendations received from provincial partners, our staff has developed communications, guidance documents and resources for local stakeholders and the public. Resources are continually updated as we learn more about COVID-19. Our public health nurses continue to work closely with residents who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 to help identify potential risk for their family members, friends or other community members who may have had contact with these individuals. By assessing the risk of exposure to others, contacting community members that may have been exposed, and providing instructions and information about next steps and self-isolation, our staff work to minimize the further spread of COVID-19 in the community. The COVID-19 situation is continually evolving and new information is being shared by the provincial and federal governments daily. At this time, the risk to the community from COVID-19 is ongoing; we will continue to engage with local and provincial partners to monitor this risk and implement provincial recommendations and directives. We are committed to keeping residents and local partners informed of the status of COVID-19 in Durham Region. You can read a detailed summary of the Health Department’s COVID-19 response activities to date in the most recent  . April 29, 2020 During this time of stress and uncertainty, it is critical that we take actions within our control to stay mentally and physically strong. Choosing nutritious foods and practicing healthy eating habits will give your body the nutrients it needs to maintain and promote good mental and physical health. While we encourage residents to limit their trips to the grocery store to once a week, we also encourage you to continue to make healthy choices when meal planning and shopping. It can sometimes be difficult to be mindful of our eating habits when spending more time at home, but we can take this opportunity to plan what we eat and cook more healthy and nutritious meals. When grocery shopping, remember to buy plenty of fruits and vegetables, choose whole grain foods and choose protein foods that come from plant sources, like beans and lentils, more often. Our   web page has several resources to help you make healthy food choices and practice healthy eating habits. There is also information on cooking on a budget and budget-wise recipes which may help residents who are living with lower incomes at this time. Please visit the   web page if you or your neighbours need help in accessing healthy foods. April 27, 2020 Over the past few weeks the Health Department has received many good questions about how COVID-19 is transmitted and the risks to the public in community settings, such as grocery stores. Scientists continue to study this virus and its characteristics, and are learning more every day. Public health professionals use the latest scientific evidence to provide the best advice possible to politicians, decision-makers and the public. Current evidence shows that the most common person-to person transmission of COVID-19 occurs via infectious respiratory droplets, which are produced when someone coughs, sneezes or speaks. The respiratory droplets are heavy and fall to surfaces quickly. The virus enters a person’s body by respiratory droplets containing the virus that adhere to mucous membranes of a person’s eyes, nose or mouth. An uninfected person can come into contact with these respiratory droplets either through close contact with someone who is infected, or by touching a surface or an object contaminated with the virus and then proceeding to touch one’s eyes, nose or mouth. The amount of time that the virus survives on surfaces varies depending on the surface itself and environmental conditions; the current range is between hours to days. This is why it is very important that we all continue to practice physical distancing by keeping at least two metres (six feet) away from others, wash our hands often and clean areas that are touched frequently (such as doorknobs). Please be aware that wearing gloves or non-medical masks alone will not protect you if you do not practice proper hand hygiene and proceed to touch your eyes, nose or mouth. If residents choose to wear gloves at a grocery store, touch an infected surface and then proceed to rub their eyes with their glove, there is a serious risk of infection. In health care settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed on an infected person, such as intubation, the procedures can generate airborne-spread which can scatter the virus further in the air and can be inhaled. Medical professionals must wear appropriate personal protective equipment when performing medical procedures and coming in contact with patients. You can stay informed about the latest evidence regarding COVID-19 by visiting the  ,   and  . Staying informed and following the advice of public health professionals is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from becoming ill. April 24, 2020 The current conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic such as boredom, drastic changes in routines, increased stress, isolation, job loss and uncertainty can lead to an increase in alcohol and cannabis use. The Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction commissioned a   which shows that many Canadians are drinking more while at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Drinking alcohol and consuming cannabis have many immediate and long-term health risks. Immediate effects of alcohol can include loss of judgement, falls and injuries, and alcohol poisoning. Long-term risks include cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke; drinking as little as one drink a day increases a person’s risk for seven different types of cancer. Health risks associated with regular or heavy cannabis use include problems with thinking, memory or co-ordination, impairment leading to injuries, hallucinations, mental health problems, and breathing or lung problems associated with smoking. While you are focusing efforts to protect yourself, your loved ones and community members from COVID-19, please be aware of other actions and behaviours which may increase risks to your health. You can visit our   and   web pages for tips and resources to help protect your health from the risks of alcohol and cannabis. April 22, 2020 Many of you have asked the Health Department for more information to help you understand the status of the spread of COVID-19 in our community. We continue to identify new and improved ways to keep residents informed so that we all have the information we need to be able to fight COVID-19 together. In my previous message about long-term care homes and retirement homes, I assured residents that we are continuing to monitor the situation very closely. Today, I am sharing how we have enhanced the   to provide residents with detailed information on the status of COVID-19 in local hospitals, long-term care homes and retirement homes. The enhancements provide information on current outbreaks in the Region and allow you to view case statistics by facility and facility type. You will also be able to see when an outbreak in a facility is declared over. We continually discuss these data with our hospital, long-term care home and retirement home partners to identify where we need to focus on mitigating risks and where greater support is needed to manage outbreaks and prevent further illness. The information on the Data Tracker is updated daily and can be accessed at  . Please visit   for resources and tools relevant to our community, and  follow us on   and   for the latest updates so that you have the information and knowledge to keep yourself and your family safe. April 20, 2020 We understand that this is a very difficult and stressful time for families who have loved ones living in long-term care and retirement homes. Residents in long-term care and retirement homes are some of the most vulnerable members of our community, and are at significantly greater risk of becoming ill from COVID-19 and suffering serious health consequences. Our heart felt condolences are extended to those who have lost family members and friends to COVID-19. The health and safety of all residents, including those in our area long-term care and retirement homes, are our top priority. Health Department staff has been working with long-term care and retirement homes to provide guidance and information that can help to reduce the risks for both residents and staff of these homes. We have been supporting long-term care and retirement homes to implement outbreak control measures including following Ministry of Health directives, supporting appropriate use of personal protective equipment, increasing environmental sanitation, cleaning and disinfection, emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene amongst residents and staff, and we maintain daily contact with homes to provide additional public health support as needed. We respond to requests quickly, facilitate testing when needed and ensure that results are received as soon as possible. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will continue to support our long-term care and retirement home partners as we fight the spread of COVID-19 together. April 16, 2020 For many of us, the COVID-19 pandemic is unlike any event we have experienced before. It is a very stressful time for all and sadly for some within our community, the challenges and hardships are far greater than they are for others. Taking care of our mental health is very important during this difficult time because good mental health helps us to cope with life’s stresses. Some of the things you can do to improve your mental health are eating a healthy diet, finding opportunities to be physically active and getting enough sleep. Please visit our   for more information and resources to support adults’, children’s and teens’ mental health.

Please take care of your mental health and reach out if you need help. April 14, 2020 Thank you to everyone who is doing their part to stay home, as much as possible, and only going out when necessary. You are helping to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our community. While we ask residents to only go out when necessary, it is still very important for our health and well-being to keep physically active. Many of us are now working from home and children have been out of school for four weeks. It is very easy to spend too much time being inactive while sitting for long periods and playing video games, reading, working at a desk, using a computer, or watching television. Remember to stand or stretch at least every 30 minutes to help reduce your sedentary time. Even though it is quite challenging to meet recommended activity levels at this time, there are resources that can help provide some ideas on being active while at home. You can visit our   to get ideas for being active indoors, such as playing active games, cleaning or putting on some music and dancing.   has also provided suggestions for being active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Going for a run or walk in your neighbourhood is still a good option to keep physically active, but only if you can practice physical distancing and keep at least two metres (six feet) away from others when outside. April 9, 2020 With increasing numbers of positive COVID-19 cases in communities across the country, governments and public health experts are continually identifying additional actions that we can all take to protect ourselves and others from becoming ill. As the situation evolves, we are also learning more about the virus everyday. We must all continue to follow instructions and wash our hands often, practice physical distancing if we must go out, avoid touching our faces, clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces frequently and self-isolate if we feel unwell. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has now advised that wearing a non-medical mask, such as a homemade cloth mask, is an additional measure that we can take to protect others in our community from becoming ill. Non-medical masks can help to reduce the risk of others coming into contact with respiratory droplets. Please refer to additional information on wearing a mask posted at   and follow   on how to do so safely. April 8, 2020 As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold globally, we have been inundated with information from a variety of sources such as television, radio and social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.). With so much material available to us, it is sometimes difficult to separate accurate information from false information. It is very important to stay informed and up to date with the most credible evidence possible so that you can protect yourself and others in our community. We continue to share information with you as it is available. In addition to our web page,  , and online resources, please be sure to refer only to credible sources of information such as the  ,  ,   and  . Staying informed and following the direction and guidance of reliable sources is the best way to stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community and #FlattenThe Curve. April 7, 2020 We know that COVID-19 is spreading throughout our community and residents with no travel history or known direct contact with positive cases are getting ill. We are continuously assessing our actions and monitoring cases to identify where we can do more. I have now taken more progressive action to protect the health of Durham Region residents. Using my legal authority under the Health Protection and Promotion Act, I have issued an order that requires anyone that has tested positive for COVID-19, or anyone who has had contact with someone who has COVID-19, to self-isolate for 14 days or longer, if directed by public health staff. Those that do not follow this order can face a fine of up to $5,000 a day. For more information and certain exceptions, please visit  . We have seen around the world how fast this virus can spread. We must all work together to keep each other healthy and safe. Please do your part and stay home when you have been instructed to self-isolate. April 6, 2020 It’s spring time and we’re finally starting to see milder temperatures. Understandably, everyone wants to spend time outside; but during these unprecedented times, we all must remember to keep our distance when going outside. On March 30, the Government of Ontario extended the Declaration of Emergency and issued a new emergency order to close all outdoor recreational amenities such as playgrounds and sports fields. Social gatherings of more than five people are also prohibited at this time. To protect yourselves and the health of our children, please respect the provincial orders and do not use play structures, basketball courts or any outdoor recreational amenities. When going outside for a walk, keep at least two metres (6 feet) away from others and remind your children to do the same. We all need to do our part to #FlattenTheCurve and help stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community. April 3, 2020 Our public health nurses and epidemiologists are continuously monitoring and tracking new and existing COVID-19 cases, so that residents are better informed of the status of COVID-19 in our community. Our new dashboard, the Durham Region COVID-19 Data Tracker, shows the number of COVID-19 cases in Durham Region by status (home isolation, hospitalized, resolved, deceased), municipality, age and gender. This resource also displays the number of new cases and cumulative cases by reported date and onset date, and is a very useful tool to keep up-to-date on the Health Department’s COVID-19 response. This information will help us to see if our actions such as social/physical distancing and self-isolation are helping to "flatten the curve", or if we need to do more. The information on the dashboard will be updated daily. Please visit us at   often and follow us on   or   for the latest updates. The COVID-19 Data Tracker was created with the assistance of the Region of Durham’s Corporate Services – Information Technology Division and the Data, Mapping & Graphics Group within the Planning & Economic Development Department. April 2, 2020 Please protect yourself and others by self-isolating if you have been instructed to do so. Self-isolating will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to your loved ones and within our community. Anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough, sore throat or difficulty breathing), is returning from travel, or has been given instructions to self-isolate by their health care provider, public health, or their workplace must self-isolate for at least 14 days. It is also recommended that anyone over 70-years old and individuals who are immunocompromised should self-isolate to protect themselves. Self-isolating means staying home and avoiding all contact with others. This means not even leaving your home to get essentials from the pharmacy or your local grocery store. If you find yourself in this situation, reach out to a family member, neighbour or friend to pick up a few essential items or ask your local pharmacy about delivery options for necessary prescription medication. Remember to keep at least two metres (six feet) away from individuals who are delivering essentials to you. Please visit   for a list of community agencies that can support residents who are alone or need help. April 1, 2020 While the COVID-19 pandemic is unlike any situation we have experienced before, our emergency planning and pandemic preparedness activities have helped to ensure that we are ready to respond to this public health emergency. We have a robust Emergency Master Plan, highly-skilled, trained and knowledgeable staff, and strong partnerships within the community which have helped us mobilize and coordinate our resources to keep community members informed and safe. We are always learning from our experiences and make the necessary adjustments and improvements to protect the health of our residents. Although our efforts are currently focused on managing and responding to COVID-19, we continue to act on critical public health concerns, health hazards and other infectious and communicable disease outbreaks. We constantly assess our capacity and resource needs to ensure continuity of essential services. The health and safety of Durham Region residents is our number one priority. March 31, 2020 The health and safety of Durham Region residents is our number one priority. At the Health Department, staff are working very hard to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in Durham Region. We do this by keeping local residents and community partners informed, monitoring and managing positive cases, facilitating testing for priority individuals, responding to inquiries, and developing health education resources. We also provide advice to Region of Durham and local area municipalities based on evidence, federal/provincial guidelines and local data, so that municipal/community leaders can make the important decisions that will help protect the health and well-being of our community. The situation not only changes daily, but often hourly. We continue to be engaged with our provincial partners so that we can share important information with residents as quickly as possible, to ensure that we continue to support you in this time of uncertainty.

Please check with your employer prior to returning to work.  Individuals who have travelled outside of Ontario, but within Canada are not subject to mandatory quarantine, but should self-monitor for 14 days upon returning to Ontario.  COVID-19 fact sheets The Ministry of Health has developed an information sheet about COVID-19 to inform Ontarians about the virus, how they can protect themselves and what to do if they think they have contracted COVID-19. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness in humans ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. A novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. In some cases, illness caused by novel coronavirus can be mild. In more severe cases, the novel coronavirus can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe influenza-like illness, kidney failure and even death.

On May 13, the case definition for COVID-19 was updated to include multisystem inflammatory vasculitis as an atypical presentation in children. This inflammatory illness has recently been reported in a small number of children worldwide in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the symptoms associated with this illness include persistent fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) as well as rash. This multisystem inflammatory vasculitis has symptoms that may also occur in Kawasaki disease (an illness that causes inflammation of the arteries). Parents should contact their health care providers if their children experience these symptoms. At this time the Ontario Ministry of Health guidance has not identified COVID-toes as an atypical symptom in children. COVID toes refers to skin findings observed in some individuals with COVID-19, characterized by swollen, painful and/or itchy lesions on the feet, toes and fingers. Please consult with your health care provider if you have concerns about your child’s health. Learn more about  . All Durham residents need to be aware of their underlying medical conditions and seek medical attention if there are changes from their regular baseline level. To reduce the spread of germs, including COVID-19 and the flu we recommend that you: Self-isolation is a strategy used to prevent COVID-19 from spreading to others. Individuals self-isolating must stay home, and limit time spent with others. While self-isolating individuals should not go to work, school, use public transportation, or go to other public areas (e.g. malls, restaurants). The following individuals are being advised to self-isolate and monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Durham Region Health Department works closely with individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID-19. This is done to help identify potential risk for other community members who may have had contact with the person diagnosed with COVID-19 while they were ill. This includes identifying and assessing the risk of exposure for individuals (e.g. health care providers who provided care for the individuals while they were ill) and community settings (e.g. clinic waiting rooms, public transit etc.). The Health Department is working collaboratively with local hospitals and health care providers to streamline processes for assessment and testing for COVID-19. For health care settings, there is specific guidance from Ontario’s Ministry of Health .

What began with a handful of mysterious illnesses in a central China city has traveled the world.  on the last day of 2019, the novel coronavirus has killed more than 577,000 people with infections surpassing 13 million worldwide. It has triggered    , stock market   and dangerous  . Most cases are mild, but health officials say much is still unknown about the virus that causes the disease . The Washington Post has spoken to scores of doctors, officials and experts to answer as many of your questions as we can about the newest  . Here’s what we know so far. These days, “coronavirus” is often prefaced with the word “novel,” because that’s precisely what it is: a new strain in a family of viruses we’ve all seen before — and, in some form, had.  , coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the   to much more serious diseases. These diseases can infect both humans and animals. The strain that began spreading in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, is related to two other coronaviruses that have caused major outbreaks in recent years: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Symptoms of a   infection range in severity from respiratory problems to cases of pneumonia, kidney failure and a buildup of fluid in the lungs. They may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. In April, the CDC   of the disease to its list, shedding more light on how the virus infects patients. The symptoms now include: a cough, shortness of breath, fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and a loss of taste or smell. Covid-19 spreads more easily than SARS and is similar to other coronaviruses that cause cold-like symptoms, experts have said. It appears to be highly transmissible, and since cases are mild, the disease may be more widespread than current testing numbers suggest.     Public health officials say the novel coronavirus is less deadly than SARS, which killed about 10 percent of people who were infected during the outbreak that began in 2002. But epidemiologists are still trying to determine exactly how deadly covid-19 is. Similar to other respiratory illnesses, older people and those with illnesses such as diabetes and high blood pressure are at increased risk. Data show that the virus is killing   in the U.S. But, as with other diseases, there can be tremendous individual variation in how people respond. There will be people with known risk factors who recover as well as people who develop severe cases for reasons we don’t understand. There’s also no evidence that children are more prone to contracting covid-19,  , and that was also the case with the disease′s cousins, SARS and MERS.     The coronavirus primarily spreads from person to person and not easily from a contaminated surface. In   issued in late-May, the CDC said the virus spreads “easily and sustainably” between people. The agency added that contaminated objects, surfaces and infected animals do not appear to be significant modes of transmission. The virus travels through the droplets a person produces when talking or coughing, the CDC website says. An individual does not need to feel sick or show symptoms to spread it.         There are some basic precautions you can take, which are the same as what you should be doing every day to stave off other respiratory diseases. You’ve seen the guidance before: Wash your hands regularly. Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze. And when you’re sick, stay home from work or school and drink lots of fluids. The CDC   washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose or sneezing. It also advises not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth and to clean objects and surfaces you touch often.             Symptoms are primarily respiratory. Coughing and shortness of breath are common, according to the CDC. Fever is also possible. The severity of the symptoms depends highly on the patient’s age and immune system. For the elderly and those with underlying heart disease, diabetes or other conditions, coronavirus can cause pneumonia and lead to organ failure and death. But  , cases have been mild, requiring little to no medical intervention.     Kawasaki disease is an inflammatory disease affecting children. In May, doctors identified a syndrome similar to Kawasaki that appeared to be triggered by covid-19. When the puzzling connection  , public health warnings focused on young patients, who have suffered symptoms that look more like traditional Kawasaki, which is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels. But in the weeks that followed, some doctors said they began to see the illness in young adults and teens, who have more of an “overwhelming” response involving the heart and multiple organs. The syndrome appears to be rare, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which recently dubbed the condition MIS-C or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children — has expressed alarm about the rapid decline of patients with the illness. The health agency and major medical groups have urged parents to seek an urgent evaluation if they suspect their child may have the condition.     It is a good idea to call your primary-care doctor if you have both a fever and a cough, experts said. And if you have shortness of breath, unremitting fever, weakness or lethargy, it’s definitely time to get in touch with a health-care professional, they say. Those could be signs of pneumonia, which is common in severe cases of coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends that you   if you recently traveled to a coronavirus-infected area or had close contact with a known infected person and have a fever, a cough or trouble breathing.     If you have mild symptoms, you probably won’t be. If you are sick enough to be hospitalized, you’ll likely get tested. If you are in the middle group, it’s unclear.  And even as more tests are being manufactured and shipped around the country, many public health labs receiving them don’t have enough staff or equipment to meet the testing need. Some medical centers are offering their own tests, and some primary care doctors are exploring how to administer the tests in their offices, but many are reluctant because it carries risks for their staff and other patients. Other hospitals and localities are setting up testing locations away from emergency rooms, clinics and doctors’ offices to minimize the risk of health care workers and other patients being infected. And, in declaring a national emergency, Trump said the administration will work with retailers like Walmart and Target to develop drive-through testing clinics across the country.     The most honest answer, according to experts, is: “It depends.” It’s not going to be over anytime soon — a matter of months rather than weeks. And a few key factors will determine just how many months. First, it depends on when U.S. cases finally reach their peak — a time that’s impossible to predict because of how  . And even after the peak, we may need drastic actions to keep the virus at bay. It also depends on how the virus behaves, and whether it’ll be  like the flu. But, ultimately, how well America is able to   of infections depends largely on how willing people will be to sacrifice individual conveniences and on their desire to save the lives of others. “I don’t know if people are ready now for how long they’re probably going to have to keep up this social distancing," said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida. "But as they see the hospital situation get more extreme, I think that attitude will change.”     This depends on where you live. Almost all states issued a sweeping directive, but in some places, cities and counties enacted their own measures. In all, 315 million Americans were affected. Most orders allowed residents to leave their homes to shop for groceries and other essentials, to exercise outdoors, to go to the doctor and to pick up prescriptions. But each jurisdiction had its own list of do’s and don’ts. Georgia, Tennessee and Florida were among the first states to begin lifting restrictions — a move that   will almost certainly lead to more infections and deaths. Other places, like New York City and California, have taken a more cautious approach. The Post is   of how states reopen.     President Trump announced new guidance in April that   to slow the spread of the coronavirus, a reversal of the administration’s earlier recommendations. The   makes clear that wearing face coverings or cloth masks is an additional public health measure to prevent the spread of the virus, not a substitute for   Social distancing of at least six feet is still recommended even when wearing a mask. Guidance and internal memos from CDC emphasize that a cloth facial mask is intended not so much to protect the wearer but to help prevent people who do not know they are infected from spreading of the virus to others. The new CDC guidance was prompted by increasing evidence that infected people without symptoms can spread the  . Simple cloth masks that cover the mouth and nose can prevent virus transmission from such individuals when they are out buying groceries, where people may come into closer contact, for example.     This coronavirus could follow a seasonal pattern, peaking in the winter months. It could infect lots of people now and then recede in the Northern Hemisphere before returning in the fall.  “This virus can do anything it wants,” said Allison McGeer, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. “That pattern of how it’s going to spread is completely unknown, but it is critical to what the burden is going to be to all of us. … It could be just like another coronavirus, a bunch of colds. It could be like a regular flu season. It’s possible it could be different and worse.”          This term refers to a family of seven known viruses that can infect people, ranging from the   to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the even deadlier Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The name comes from the virus’s shape, which under a microscope  like a blob surrounded by crown-like spikes.  Sometimes used interchangeably with coronavirus and the official name SARS-CoV-2,   refers to the disease the virus causes. So SARS-CoV-2 causes covid-19, just as HIV causes AIDS.  This happens when a disease circulates among people in a certain area who did not travel to an affected location and have no close link to other confirmed cases.   Asymptomatic carriers of the virus are people who show no signs of being sick but have the virus and can spread it to others.   A sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease in a particular place and time.  A  that spreads among a population or in a region.  An epidemic that has become rampant in multiple countries and continents simultaneously.   A phrase that experts use when talking about the need to use protective measures to slow the spread of new cases. It refers to the powerful visual illustration seen on a statistical chart. A flattened curve is the difference between a viral outbreak that has the profile of Mount Everest, exploding vertically, and one that slowly unfolds over time — a long, low hill. In the early phases of an epidemic, countries often use this strategy of trying to corral and beat back the advance of a virus in hopes of limiting its spread and possibly stamping it out. They restrict movement of people, enact travel bans and quarantine. To use a military analogy, it is treating new cases like a beachhead invasion and surrounding and beating back each new beachhead. Once it’s clear you’re dealing with widespread transmission that will be difficult if not impossible to contain, authorities begin focusing instead on wider preparations like getting hospitals ready to handle influx of patients, stockpiling materials and enacting social distancing policies. Keeping those who are sick and infected away from those who aren’t is referred to as isolation. Hospitals have taken strict measures to isolate coronavirus patients using isolation wards, ventilators that prevent air from circulating more widely and heavy protective gear for health workers.  Restricting the movement of people who seem healthy but may have been exposed to the virus is known as a quarantine. Americans who were evacuated from Wuhan and cruise ships, for example, have been kept in   on military bases for 14 days, which is what experts believe is the virus’s incubation period.  The new coronavirus was transmitted from animals to people, making it zoonotic. SARS came from civets, which are like cats, and MERS came from camels, but it’s not yet known what animal caused the current coronavirus outbreak. The   so far is the  .     
   Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold. However, three new coronaviruses have emerged from animal reservoirs over the past two decades to cause serious and widespread illness and death. There are hundreds of coronaviruses, most of which circulate among such animals as pigs, camels, bats and cats. Sometimes those viruses jump to humans—called a spillover event—and can cause disease. Four of the seven known coronaviruses that sicken people cause only mild to moderate disease. Three can cause more serious, even fatal, disease. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in November 2002 and caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). That virus disappeared by 2004. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Transmitted from an animal reservoir in camels, MERS was identified in September 2012 and continues to cause sporadic and localized outbreaks. The third novel coronavirus to emerge in this century is called SARS-CoV-2. It causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged from China in December 2019 and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Building on previous research on SARS and MERS, NIAID scientists and grantees are well positioned to rapidly develop COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. These projects include conducting basic research to understand how the virus infects cells and causes disease, and what interventions can prevent and stop the spread of disease. In fact, within two weeks of the discovery of COVID-19, NIAID researchers had determined how the virus enters cells. And within two months sites had begun Phase 1 trials of a   (remdesivir) and a   (mRNA-1273). After SARS-CoV emerged from China in November 2002 it spread to 26 countries within a few months, largely by infected passengers who traveled. More than 8,000 people fell ill and 774 died. SARS drew the collective focus of researchers throughout the world. The disease disappeared in 2004, likely due to intensive contact tracing and case isolation measures. In September 2012, a new coronavirus was identified in the Middle East causing an illness similar to SARS. Again, researchers at NIAID and across the globe initiated studies to understand MERS-CoV and how to stop it. Research efforts from those two outbreaks—including development of a DNA vaccine candidate for SARS by NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center—have prepared scientists to quickly assess the severity and transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2, and to develop countermeasures. When MERS emerged in 2012 and COVID-19 was identified in 2020, NIAID intramural and extramural scientists mobilized quickly to study the viruses, efforts which continue today. Key areas of investigation include basic research on their origins, how they cause disease, and developing animal study models, new treatments, and vaccines. The NIAID Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Research details the institute’s priorities for controlling and ultimately ending the spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes (COVID-19). The plan focuses on four key research areas to accomplish this.

 In January 2020, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the cause of an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The disease, later named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), subsequently spread globally. In the first three months after COVID-19 emerged nearly 1 million people were infected and 50,000 died. 
 NIAID-funded scientists are exploring ways to treat and prevent human coronavirus infections by working to develop new antibodies, drugs, and vaccines. Some block the virus from entering cells, some delay the immune system response, and some block viral replication. 
 NIAID is conducting and supporting a range of clinical studies to prevent, treat and better understand both the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the disease it can cause (COVID-19).

 Quick Links   NEW:  Remember to  : Last revised on July 24, 2020 The increase in reported cases of COVID-19 in recent days is a stark reminder of the potential for this virus to spread if it is given the chance to do so. With the virus present in our community and the vast majority of us being susceptible to infection, we all need to continue to be   to prevent transmission.  Many cases are linked to multiple large indoor social gatherings involving a range of age groups. Indoor gatherings are a high-risk activity that can lead to ‘super-spreader events’ in which multiple people can become infected who can then expose others in their households, social contacts and places of employment. Transmission is not limited to these large gatherings but can occur when distancing and mask use have not been maintained. In addition, people with symptoms have gone to social gatherings or work increasing the risk of transmission.   Please continue to be   and assess the risk of the activities in which you engage. Practice physical distancing, wear a mask when you are not able to distance or when in an indoor public space, isolate when sick and exercise proper hand hygiene. The Province has set limits at 50 people for indoor gatherings and 100 people for outdoor gatherings. These are with physical distancing (and mask use for indoor gatherings) for people outside your household and social circle. There are a number of strategies that can be used to reduce the risk of transmission for social gatherings: stay outdoors, remind people not to come if feeling sick or unwell, limit the number of people and plan seating to ensure physical distancing between households/social circles, sanitize hands frequently and limit the duration of gatherings.  A social circle extends your household to include other family and/or close friends of no more than 10 people (less is better) with mutual agreement that they will exclusively interact with each other without physical distancing. Each person can only be in one social circle.  If you establish your own social circle and just one person in your circle establishes another social circle, this opens transmission to up to 20 people. Imagine if everyone from your social circle did this. Knowing where the virus is coming from and who may have been exposed is another reason why contained circles are important. We have all made sacrifices, but we must continue to assess the risk of every activity in which we engage especially if it involves gathering with those outside your social circle. Please continue to distance when seeing those from outside of your circle and use a mask when you can’t to add an extra layer of protection. Last weekend saw crowded streets in the ByWard Market. As bars and restaurants reopen, we need to be cautious of congestion that can lead to the transmission of COVID-19 by not distancing and not using masks outside in crowded areas. While being outdoors generally lowers risk of COVID-19 transmission, you still need to maintain that physical space between others. Socializing is important for our mental health. So, it means being “social wise” when you socialize to reduce the risk of such activities. This means keeping visits with friends shorter, reducing the number of participants, meeting outdoors and maintaining a two-metre distance.If you are going out in public, please have a mask on you at all times if you find you are not able to maintain a physical distance of at least two metres from others. The City’s   also indicates masks are mandatory in enclosed public settings like restaurants, bars and movie theatres. For more information on masks, visit  . OPH continues to provide guidance to businesses and workplaces on how to reopen and provide service as safely as possible. OPH encourages daily self-screening for symptoms of COVID-19 among employees before they arrive at work to ensure they stay home if they are sick. Businesses have been provided resources including an employee screening questionnaire, posters and online tools to assist in the screening process. More workplace guidance and resources are available on our website at  .  OPH is thankful to the business community for continued innovation, sacrifice and commitment over the past several months in our collective efforts to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on our city. Ottawa is lucky to have such an engaged and responsible business community. These actions have helped support the health of our city during this difficult time. Continued efforts to be   and COVID Kind are incredibly important moving forward.  Through our case management and data collection efforts, we can identify outbreaks and where they come from and are reaching 100 per cent of cases and 93 per cent of close contacts within 24 hours. If Ottawa enters a situation where we are seeing rapid community transmission, further increases in hospitalizations and outbreaks and overwhelming demand on testing and contact tracing capacity, we are at risk of undoing the hard work that has gotten us to Stage 3. Ottawa, now is the time to act. Being   is the hammer in our toolbelt. Maintain a distance of two metres, wear a mask, stay home when sick and practice proper hand hygiene. Assess your own risk when choosing activities and ask yourself how you can make it safer. We did this successfully to get to Stage 3; we need to apply these techniques to the same degree moving forward. We anticipated some bumps along the way. It has been a long journey and now is not the time to let up. I know that we can continue to be cautious and   to protect ourselves and others. Our community is a strong one and we will continue to move forward during these uncertain times. Thank you for the work you have done so far. Let’s continue to move through this together. Today as we enter Stage 3 of the province’s recovery plan, I am reflecting on how incredibly significant the changes in the behaviour of residents of Ottawa have been. Your actions have added up to protection against COVID-19 at the population level. By following public health measures like physical distancing, wearing a mask, staying home when you are sick and washing your hands, more people are able to get back to work and access more services. Because the virus is still in our community, we need to continue to take care. With new provincial guidance allowing up to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors and more businesses reopening, there are going to be increased opportunities to interact with others and therefore more cases of COVID-19 can be expected.  Breaking these chains of transmission to keep the level of virus in the community manageable is our collective goal as we learn to live with COVID-19 into the future. No activity can be made completely safe, so I recommend everyone assess their own risk level before engaging in certain activities. Are you, or are you living with, someone who is at higher risk of complications from COVID-19? Is there something you can do, like wear a mask, to make the activity safer? Do the risks outweigh the necessity of the activity? Choose lower-risk activities that are outdoors, involve physical distancing from others and with smaller groups. Starting today, gatherings of up to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors are allowed in Ontario. However, provincial requirements are to maintain social circles at no more than 10 people. To clarify, social circles are the members of our household plus others (up to 10) where there is close contact, whereas physical distancing is still required for all other gatherings. The rationale is to keep the opportunity for COVID-19 transmission low. To help limit the spread of COVID-19 and prepare for Stage 3 of the provincial reopening plan, City Council approved a temporary by-law to make masks mandatory in indoor public spaces. This includes restaurants, stores, places of worship, sports facilities, community venues, hotel lobbies and the public areas of City and health facilities. Masks continue to be required on transit and transit property. Evidence continues to build that masks are an additional layer of protection when there is community transmission of the virus, including from asymptomatic people. There are some people who are unable to wear a mask, such as children under two years of age, individuals with breathing or cognitive difficulties and anyone who is unable to remove a mask without help. Proof of exemption is not required and Ottawa Public Health will continue to communicate about this. I ask you to continue to be understanding and compassionate. For those who can wear masks: please do so to help protect those who can’t. Residents are encouraged to continue practicing physical distancing, wash their hands frequently and stay home when sick. As businesses reopen, we encourage them to seek information from the   for guidelines related to masks and other ways to avoid outbreaks in workplace. Ottawa Public Health is not approving specific business plans for reopening but is providing proactive advice and addressing questions from businesses as needed. For businesses not yet permitted to open, they can connect with the  . For more information on preventing COVID-19 in the workplace, please visit  . I realize that for many it may be discouraging to hear that COVID-19 will be with us for the foreseeable future. The idea of living with COVID-19 for several months, even years, can sound overwhelming. It is important to shift to the long-term view and to be realistic. Until there is a vaccine available, we must learn to do things differently to continue to protect each other. Ottawa, you may not realize it, but you are incredibly resilient. Look at how much we have adapted to and accomplished in the last few months! You have learned new ways of living, some of which may seem normal now. I have every confidence that we will get through this new phase. This is in our hands. Please continue to be   as we learn to live with COVID-19. It may be a long road, there may be some bumps, but we will continue as the strong community that we have become.  We’re in this for the long haul, Ottawa, but we’re in this together. This is why the City of Ottawa will join other municipalities across the Province of Ontario and will mandate the use of cloth masks in many indoor public spaces. The City of Ottawa has engaged in conversations with City partners, neighbouring health units and members of the business community to explore all possibilities for the establishment of a City of Ottawa By-law requiring residents to wear a cloth mask. Following these conversations, the City of Ottawa is confident in moving forward with the decision to mandate cloth mask use in indoor public spaces. In speaking with the members of our business community, we’ve heard from business owners that they are in favour of mandating the wearing of cloth masks in indoor public spaces. This by-law would ensure that all businesses are on a level playing field. The decrease in transmission will benefit our local economy by allowing increased use of our excellent local establishments and greater customer comfort. We believe that one of the many ways to support local small businesses is to do whatever we can, such as wearing a cloth mask, to help them stay open. The motion to institute a by-law ensuring that residents of the City of Ottawa wear a cloth mask that covers their nose, mouth and chin, without any gaping in certain circumstances will be brought up at Council on July 15th. The Motion will be moved by Councillor Egli and seconded by Mayor Watson. Until such by-law is in effect in Ottawa, the four health units in the Champlain region are looking at a regional approach to mandate masks in their respective jurisdictions. More information about this regional approach will be provided at a joint media availability on Monday, July 6 to be held with Medical Officer’s of Health from four surrounding public health units. Ottawa Public Health’s most recent public engagement survey found that the vast majority of residents from Ottawa are willing to have cloth masks use made mandatory in stores in order for them to feel comfortable shopping. Socializing and normalizing cloth masks in indoor public places will help protect our community. According to phase 1 of OPH’s engagement survey, 90 per cent of respondents said that they would willingly wear a cloth mask in order to be allowed access to services. In our phase 2 survey, so far 73 per cent of respondents say they already wear a cloth mask when visiting an indoor public space. In addition, we strongly believe that the benefits of wide-spread cloth mask use will set us up for a better transition into Stage 3. The Province of Ontario states that a transition to Stage 3 will only be allowed if it can be done as safely as possible. The wide-spread use of cloth masks will assist with better protecting Ottawa residents from COVID-19 transmission during the transition to Stage 3. The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and has impacted the way we live, work and play. Information about the virus continues to evolve but what we know today is that wearing cloth masks is a key component to protecting our community from COVID-19. Community spirit is strong in Ottawa. It is important to state that there may be many in our community who won’t be able to wear a cloth mask due to a variety of reasons such as pre-existing medical conditions, being a child under the age of two, being someone who requires accommodation in accordance with the Ontario Human Rights Code or someone who is hearing impaired or who is communicating with a person who is hearing impaired. Please be prepared to see some individuals in public without cloth masks and we ask that you please be respectful. We understand that this a change for many. Be patient. Be kind with yourself and others. Wearing a cloth mask in indoor public spaces is new to many of us and will be an adjustment. We are all in this together. Let’s continue to protect the people who live in our city because wearing a cloth mask is a small sacrifice if it means saving lives and reducing the spread of COVID-19 in Ottawa. My cloth mask protects you, and your cloth masks protects me. This year, Canada Day is going to look and feel a little different. With no signature events downtown or large community gatherings, you may find yourself finding new ways to celebrate Canada Day. The most Canadian thing we can do is continue to care and protect others by   during Canada Day celebrations.  However you choose to celebrate Canada Day this year, I encourage everyone to continue to practice physical distancing, wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible, limit your contacts, stay home if you’re sick and exercise good hand washing hygiene. While provincial emergency orders allow for gatherings of up to 10 people, the fewer close contacts you have the better.  While planning your Canada Day activities, keep in mind these considerations to celebrate in a safer way: Let’s celebrate our country and our city by protecting the people who live here.   As we continue to move through Stage 2 of reopening, we are continuing the hard work that has allowed us to get here. We are seeing second waves emerge in other parts of the world and, while we are fortunately in a much better position here in Ottawa at this point, we are also at risk of a second wave. We can watch other countries and communities to learn about what works to control COVID19 and adapt approaches to what is appropriate for our city. Currently case numbers are steady, outbreaks are decreasing and we are maximizing testing and contact tracing capacity. This is good news, but the positive case numbers you see updated on our website every day are still just a fraction of the infections truly present in the community. The risk of an increase in COVID19 cases and outbreaks is real. Modelling data shows that a decline of just twenty per cent in public control measures could lead to a second wave. Our actions influence whether a second wave occurs and its severity. Ottawa residents have already shown that they are capable of doing what needs to be done to keep the virus at a manageable level. Our community spirit is strong. According to  , the majority of residents (90 per cent) agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to wear non-medical or cloth masks in order to be allowed to access services. Three quarters (74 per cent) agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to wear a non-medical or cloth mask in the workplace. And preliminary data from   which started last Thursday so far indicates that 71 per cent of residents wore a mask in indoor public spaces either “most of the time” or “always” in the last seven days.  This percentage has been growing and we continue to observe room for improvement in mask wearing to protect each other. While the data shows that many people are already doing the right thing by wearing a mask, we are seriously exploring our options for making masks mandatory in commercial settings in Ottawa. I am having conversations with the Mayor, our City partners and neighbouring health units to ensure we are well coordinated in our actions and will provide more information before the end of the week. It may be uncomfortable to wear a mask especially with the warmer weather, however wearing a mask will help protect others. If you are able, please wear a mask when going somewhere you cannot guarantee the ability to physically distance. If you’re not sure if where you’re going may require a mask, it’s a good idea to get in the habit of keeping one on your person at all times. My mask protects you and your mask protects me. Wearing a mask is a small sacrifice if it means saving lives. It is exciting news that City beaches are now open. This is a great way to cool off and enjoy time with those in your household. Our advice is to avoid larger crowds where you are unable to physically distance to protect yourselves and those around you. If you do plan on spending some time at the beach this summer, be sure to remember the COVIDWise basics. Remain cautious of communal areas such as washrooms and high-touch surfaces. More information on water safety can be found on the  This summer will be different from those past. Still, I hope that you can use this time to create many wonderful memories of a summer of overcoming the challenges of COVID19. Being COVIDWise is key to moving into Stage 3 and beyond. I wish everyone a safe and happy Canada Day. Based on the most recent modelling update, Ottawa is currently at 68 per cent physical distancing effectiveness. Physical distancing effectiveness describes how fast COVID-19 spreads in Ottawa compared to if there was no physical distancing. In other words, the higher the percentage, the better. If there is perfect or 100 per cent physical distancing effectiveness, there would be no COVID-19 spread.    At the beginning of COVID-19 in Ottawa, new cases and hospitalizations doubled every three to four days. As people in Ottawa began to physically distance, the spread of COVID-19 slowed.  Currently, hospital admissions are slower than the initial three to four days doubling time, but we have not yet eliminated all COVID-19 growth.​ Everyone's actions have contributed to flattening the curve and have allowed us to move into Stage 2 of reopening. We must stay the course.  :  ear a mask,  solate when sick (and seek testing if you have symptoms),  tay two metres apart from others and  xercise proper hand hygiene. It is up to you to make informed decisions and lessen your risk of infection and the risk to people close to you.  Being COVIDWise saves lives. On May 8, OPH started collecting socio-demographic data from people diagnosed with COVID-19. A preliminary look at data collected so far tells us that there may be an over-representation of people who are racialized and immigrants compared with Census 2016 data.   This preliminary data is consistent with what is being seen elsewhere. We will be working with community partners such as the Ottawa Local Immigration Partnership to understand these numbers. We need to better understand how people’s experiences and life situations are creating this unfair vulnerability to COVID-19 in order to address these differences and barriers. We are expanding our work to collect socio-demographic information from people who were diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to May 8 which will allow us to complete fulsome analysis of the data. The impacts of COVID-19 extend beyond the infection itself. OPH has been surveying Ottawa residents to understand how people are managing the health and social impacts of COVID-19. In June, we asked about mental health and emotional well-being including sense of community belonging and loneliness. Some of the findings include: This data will continue to help inform OPH and our partners on how to best support the mental health and wellness in our community. A report with these findings will be available soon. Visit our   and our   for currently available mental health resources.    We would like to thank EKOS Research for their collaboration on the survey. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 response, hundreds of public health and City staff have been working hard to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Ottawa. In all my years in public health, I have never seen so many people come together and work with such passion and purpose to protect our community. Their continuous commitment and hard work day and night, seven days a week makes me proud to be part of this organization. Thank you to all of OPH and the City for the collective approach. We have worked collaboratively with our partners to keep our community safe and to protect those at higher risk. The combined efforts of public health, local partners and the community are making a difference. Thousands of lives have been saved.

This day allows us to celebrate the vital role that the Francophone community has played within Canada since its foundation. We are proudly bilingual and we hope you enjoy yourselves safely today. Kwey, Aniin, Shé:kon, Ainngai, Taanshi, This past weekend we celebrated both National Indigenous Peoples Day and summer solstice, a time of celebration and new beginnings. Many Ottawans spent the weekend outdoors and enjoyed the beauty of the traditional unceded Algonquin territory. June is also Indigenous History Month, a time to learn about and acknowledge the rich diversity of cultures and traditions of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. Ottawa Public Health (OPH) is committed to reconciliation. We work in partnership with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples and communities to advance Indigenous health equity and address anti-Indigenous racism. Currently we are working with partners to better understand how COVID-19 is affecting Indigenous communities, including the health and social effects of closures and physical distancing on First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. As part of our pandemic response, OPH has launched   that highlights COVID-19 resources for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis community members. Resources include information developed by Ottawa Public Health and local, provincial and national Indigenous organizations. Several of the resources are available in a number of Indigenous languages that reflect the diversity of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples in Ottawa. Please take the opportunity to learn about First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples, anti-Indigenous racism, and to reflect on a personal commitment to address past and current injustices. Meegwetch, Nia:wen, Qujannamiik, Marsee. Just over a week has passed since many businesses and childcare services started to reopen under provincial guidance. OPH continues to monitor and assess the situation as it evolves and is working closely with the business community to provide new tools to support them in reopening safely. Ottawa businesses are working hard and quickly adapting to the new requirements to keep their employees and customers as safe as possible. Let's honour their efforts by being respectful and patient customers that protect the health of employees. Visit our   to see the updated guidance documents for businesses as well as a new  . As we continue to reopen and consistently report low new case numbers, please remember to be  . We can continue to flatten the curve as we take advantage of the new opportunities to explore and socialize while COVID-19 is present in our community.  – Wear a cloth mask when you cannot maintain a physical distance of two metres.  – Isolate yourself form others when you are sick (and get tested promptly if you have COVID-like symptoms).  – Stay two metres apart from those outside your household.  – Exercise proper hand hygiene; wash your hands regularly or use sanitizer especially before touching your face. Activities have high to low levels of risk when it comes to spreading the virus. Be   by using information available on our website to help choose your activities as we work to keep the virus under control. The community of Ottawa has demonstrated that we are all able to protect each other and keep this virus at a manageable level. But we are not yet on the other side of this which is why being COVIDWise is crucial as we continue to live with COVID-19. Racism, discrimination and stigma are associated with poor physical, mental and emotional health and higher mortality rates. Anti-black racism, anti-indigenous racism and racism against any minority is an important public health issue. I am pleased to share that this week, the Ottawa Board of Health unanimously approved a motion that recognizes racism as a public health issue and will direct Ottawa Public Health’s (OPH) work in addressing racism in public health. This motion included directives to: OPH is committed to engage and work with residents, partners and communities to develop the conditions to support health and health equity for everyone in Ottawa. In addition to partnerships to help us move in a direction that will lead to meaningful change, we will engage with Councilor Rawlson King, the council Liaison for Anti-Racism and Ethnocultural Relations Initiatives for the City of Ottawa. As you are aware, last week OPH introduced its new  . Additionally, supplemental COVID-19 epidemiology reports are made available on  . These include the most current information available from the dynamic disease reporting system as of 2 p.m. the day before posting. Some weeks, there will be a   included in a Weekly Supplement that will provide a brief analysis of a topic of interest. Today’s  provides more information about the occupations of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Information on the occupations of those infected with COVID-19 can improve our understanding of who may be at higher risk and how the disease is spreading. While this report does not suggest exposure sites, this is information that is collected during the case management process.  Among occupational groups, healthcare workers have had the greatest number of infections to-date. It’s important to note that the testing of healthcare workers and essential workers has been prioritized compared to the rest of the population.  As we continue to ease restrictions, everyone is encouraged to be vigilant, regardless of their occupation. OPH will continue to monitor trends as more settings re-open.   As many businesses continue to reopen and we increase our activities, OPH will continue to monitor the level of infection in the community. It will take a period of weeks before we can assess the impact of reopening. Looking at the latest data, the trends are positive across all the recovery indicators of our   though we are still finding cases that have no known source of infection. This means that these cases are not linked to travel, an outbreak or another known case. Since we are reopening while COVID-19 is present in our community, more widespread transmission risks a resurgence of the virus, which could again threaten the health of vulnerable individuals and surpass our hospitals’ capacity. We each need to continue to do our part to prevent transmission of the virus. With reopening, we are faced with more choices of what we might do. However, not all activities have the same risk for transmission. In general, being outside is better than inside, the fewer our contacts the lower the risk, and physical distancing continues to be of primary importance. Being COVIDwise will help prevent transmission for yourself, your family and others. This includes: wear a cloth mask when you cannot maintain physical distance with others, isolate yourself and get tested when you are sick, and wash your hands regularly. Whether as a participant in an activity, or a close contact of another who is participating, particular caution is needed for vulnerable individuals at increased risk of serious outcomes if they become infected. See our   for more information on risk categories of different types of activities, as well as how to be COVIDwise.   The reality is that this isn't the end. We must all continue cautiously to prevent infections and keep the virus at a manageable level in our community. Testing and follow-up is not enough to control the virus; we must prevent transmission in the first place. That’s why I am asking each and every one of you to continue to be  .  – Wear a cloth mask when you cannot maintain a physical distance of two metres.  – Isolate yourself form others when you are sick (and get tested promptly if you have COVID-like symptoms).  – Stay two metres apart from those outside your household.  – Exercise proper hand hygiene; wash your hands regularly or use sanitizer especially before touching your face. As we enter Stage 2 and resume some of our activities, being able to assess your individual situation and the associated risks and make informed decisions is key. Because what is permissible under the provincial order will continue to change and does not address all possible scenarios, some confusion may result. There are differences between what is legally allowed and what is recommended. I appreciate that for some people this may cause a level of anxiety. OPH is here to help residents through any uncertain times by emphasizing the principles to decrease risk that do not change. The province is now allowing group gatherings to increase from five to 10 people. And earlier today the province announced guidance on how to establish a social circle with those outside your household. No matter what, it is still wise to limit your contacts and keep gatherings to fewer people and to the same group of people over time. Try to keep your activities outdoors. And, assess your own unique situations and associated risks – for example, whether you are or live with someone who may be at higher risk of serious complications from COVID-19. We have heard concerns from adults over 70 years old that they are not sure which activities they can or should resume. Just like everyone else, you need to assess your own risk as older adults are more vulnerable to this virus and keep in mind the principles of reducing the risk of transmission. We continue to work with our City of Ottawa partners to provide more guidance on how to safely resume business. We have contributed to the  , provided specific guidance for restaurants, businesses that provide personal services and will be holding a variety of workshops over the next several weeks for different businesses like day camps and childcare services, construction and manufacturing, offices and professional services, retail and vehicle dealerships and more. Our local businesses sacrificed much by staying closed or reducing services to help limit the spread of COVID-19. Let's honour their efforts by being respectful and patient customers that protect the health of employees. Let's learn to be COVID-wise: visit   for more information. Yesterday the Province of Ontario announced that visits will be allowed to resume in long-term care and retirement homes starting June 18 with certain limitations. For example, a home must not be in outbreak, must have established visitor protocols in place and must maintain the highest infection prevention and control standards. Only outdoor visits will be permitted during this first phase, and only one visitor at a time per resident. According to the provincial Ministry of Long-Term Care policy, visitors will be required to pass active screening every time they visit, confirming with staff that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within the previous two weeks. Visitors should consider their personal health and susceptibility to the virus in determining whether visiting a long-term care home is appropriate. It is important to note that homes can decide if they want or need to continue prohibiting visits, and if so, they should continue to offer virtual visits. The actions of one visitor that may unknowingly introduce COVID19 into a home could lead to extremely negative consequences, so utmost care is important. The role that families, visitors and loved ones play in providing care-giving and emotional supports is important for the quality of life and health for residents in long-term care homes and must be balanced with mitigating the risk of death for residents. More information on long-term care home visits can be found at  . Data plays an important part in helping to guide us in our community response with recommendations as we move forward into new stages of reopening. Earlier this week we launched our new  , a live interactive tool that is updated daily as data becomes available from the COVID-19 Ottawa Database. This dynamic tool serves as your primary source of up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases, outbreaks and core indicators for local monitoring. The new tool provides a comprehensive snapshot of information that was previously housed in more than one place. You can still find  s prior to June 10 on our website, however, moving forward you will be able to use the interactive dashboard to find current information. My team has developed a   to help users understand how to use the tool. The guide is available on the website in the same location of the dashboard. We welcome your feedback as we continue to prioritize transparency and share information with the public. My focus and Ottawa Public Health’s role is to provide guidance and help you make informed decisions to keep our City healthy. With ongoing caution, we can get back to more of the things we enjoy safely. Stay safe and be COVIDWise. Ottawa Public Health (OPH) has launched a new dynamic reporting tool to compliment the  . This tool will provide up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases, outbreaks and core indicators to assess the situation in Ottawa. The new tool provides a comprehensive snapshot of information that was previously housed in more than one place. To facilitate access we have streamlined information into one interactive daily report and a weekly supplement.  OPH prides itself on its transparent reporting of information. We welcome your continued feedback on our reports and the way we are presenting information to the public.  In March, we completed the first wave of a population-level survey looking at  . We recently completed a second wave of questions for the public about mask use, hand hygiene and physical distancing practices.  The majority of Ottawans report wearing masks indoors, washing their hands before eating, and maintaining a distance of 2 metres from others when indoors.  These measures will prevent transmission of COVID19 in our community and are important to continue.  By learning more about how Ottawa residents are managing through this time, we are better equipped to work with the community to provide supports where needed. ​ ​​OPH thanks the team at EKOS Research Associates for their collaboration on these two survey streams. ​ With the provincial announcement of Stage 2 “reopening” starting on Friday June 12 in Ottawa, many questions have been raised as people try to grasp the nuances and how it impacts their ability to see their families and socialize. While the province has said we can now gather in groups of 10 or less, physical distancing is still required when meeting with people outside your household to limit transmission of COVID-19, as there are still cases arising in the community with no known exposure. Furthermore, limiting your number of contacts to the same small group of people as much as possible will add to our ability to keep the level of COVID-19 transmission under control. We have to continue to be cautious with reopening; with each additional opportunity to interact with others, there is an increased risk of virus transmission.   I am confident that we can enter Stage 2 with ongoing care. The data shows that Ottawa residents have heard our public health messaging loud and clear, and it is your actions that have allowed us to transition into this new stage. Cases, hospitalizations and outbreaks have all decreased. Hospital capacity is positive. We are on target with contacting cases and their follow up.  Testing volume is up and the percentage of tests that are positive is down. We have gotten this far, and we cannot let up on our efforts to control the virus. The future is in our hands, Ottawa.  :  ear a mask,  solate when sick (and seek testing if you have symptoms),  tay two metres apart from others, and  xercise proper hand hygiene. Everyone’s actions have helped keep the transmission of the virus down and prevent our healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed. As we enter Stage 2, it’s up to you to make informed decisions and lessen your risk of infection and the risk to people close to you. Stay the course Ottawa. We are in this together.  Thank you for your continuing care. Some people have been describing this week’s marches as a conflict between democracy and protecting the health of the population. I don’t see it that way.  There are two challenges to the health of the population that are raised by the marches.  And, one of them has far deeper roots and has had negative impacts on public health for far longer than the other. Anti-black racism and racism against minorities makes our population less healthy. Racism, discrimination and stigma are associated with poorer physical, mental and emotional health and greater mortality.  My job is to not only control infectious diseases but also to promote the health of the population by working with others to ensure fair opportunities for health. We have seen how COVID-19 has stigmatized certain racialized groups. According to a   published by Public Health Ontario on COVID-19 and diversity, the most ethno-culturally diverse neighbourhoods in Ontario, primarily those concentrated in large urban areas, are experiencing disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19 and related deaths compared to neighbourhoods that are the less diverse. The rate of COVID-19 infections in the most diverse neighbourhoods was three times higher than the rate in the least diverse neighbourhoods. And people living in the most diverse neighbourhoods were also more likely to experience severe outcomes (hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths) than people living in the least diverse neighbourhoods, even after controlling for age and population concentration: We need better data to understand how racism is affecting people’s health. We are working with groups such as the Ottawa Local Immigration Partnership and with health system partners to collect race and ethnicity data in order to better understand the barriers to health and healthcare in Ottawa, and health outcomes for people who are racialized. People have had disproportionately difficult impacts on their lives and it is important for people to have a voice within our democracy to counter racism. Today, I am finding virtual ways to express my support and continuing work within my institution to make changes to address anti-black racism and racism against minorities. Ottawa Public Health is focusing on work that we all need to do to change how our programs and services support people who have the least advantage and are harmed by racism. Today, I encourage you to take action by learning more about what is happening in our community, and about how racism affects the health of our population. Speak to your children about racism. Speak out when you see racism happening and recognize when even you yourself might be guilty of stereotyping or bias. When we have privilege we need to work to grow the opportunities for people who have less. And ensure voices of people with less advantage are heard. We understand that people are hurting. We are listening. As for the other risk to the health of our population raised by the marches – COVID-19 – large numbers crowding within two metres of others does create a high risk for transmission of the virus.  OPH is providing information to make sure people make the decision to march in an informed way. Be as safe as possible if you are marching today.  Stay home if you are ill and make sure you present for testing if you develop symptoms of illness in the two weeks following participating in the march.  Thank you for continuing to limit the number of contacts that you have as much as possible.  Your work to physically distance in the days following the march continues to be important to limit deaths due to COVID-19. Together with Ottawa Public Health, United Way recently launched their #FacingForward project. As we continue to strongly recommend the use of cloth masks when physical distancing is not possible, we recognize that for many acquiring a cloth mask isn’t as easy as it sounds. Whether it’s poverty, homelessness or isolation that make getting a mask a challenge, we need to fill those gaps and ensure everyone has what they need to keep our communities healthy. We are asking the community to help in three different ways where possible: You can buy, give or even make masks. We are committed to making sure that every person in the community is protected. More information can be found on the United Way’s website -   It goes without saying that 2020 has been a different and difficult year for all of us. The more we start to interact in public again, the more mindful we must be of our actions to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Through everyone’s actions, we have been successful in reducing the number of infections that would have otherwise occurred. Overall, we estimate that only a small percentage of Ottawans have been infected with COVID so far, perhaps as low as one per cent, but possibly a bit higher. Regardless of the specific number, the key implication is that the vast majority of us remain susceptible to infection. The new cases and hospitalizations we report mean that the virus is still present in our community. In order to track cases within Ottawa and to limit transmission, please seek testing if you think you may be infected with the virus. As more activities become possible, the new normal will be to consider how risky an activity is and how you can reduce the risk of transmission for yourself, your family and others. In general, outdoor activities are less risky than indoor ones. The more people that are involved, and the closer the contact, the higher the risk. Another important consideration is whether any of the individuals or the people in their households are at risk of serious outcomes if they become infected. As our city reopens, we are asking the public to be COVID wise and assess the risk of your chosen activity. Assess the situation, consider whether the activity is lower or higher risk, or somewhere in-between, and whether physical distancing can be maintained. Wearing a cloth masks is an important strategy when distancing cannot be maintained. For extra help on low- to high-risk activities, please see the OPH website for more information. The overarching need to prevent transmission of COVID-19 is of utmost importance as we get back to activities. We are in this together in every way. Everyone within the community continues to have a role to play in preventing spread of the virus and we thank you for all of your efforts to do so. Recent events in the news involving racial violence have left many Ottawa residents and Canadians hurt, angry and looking for answers. Much of the attention has focused on the United States, but with our proximity to the US and our own continuing issues with racism, this has led to protests across our nation as well. Racism is a public health issue and Ottawa is not immune. Sadly, with the emergence of COVID-19, we have seen rising racism, xenophobia, discrimination, hate incidents and crimes targeting our Asian communities globally and here in Canada. As a virus, COVID-19 does not discriminate. Anyone can be infected. Evidence has shown that certain groups may be more impacted by COVID-19 than others due to broader health and social factors that increase the risk of contracting the disease and of being able to protect others. COVID-19 affects us all, but some people are facing incredibly difficult circumstances and hardships. Support, kindness and compassion is what we need now. As an organization, Ottawa Public Health (OPH) has been proactive in assessing how to better educate our staff on the issues relating to racism regarding health and access to care. We are working with our City partners to confront and address systemic racism throughout our community. Marches are taking place all over the world this week including here in Ottawa. We understand that people want to gather to march and express themselves. If you are planning on joining the crowds to march this week, please do so responsibly by taking steps to keep yourself and other participants as safe as possible to reduce the risk of transmission: If you are more susceptible to serious complications if you contract COVID-19 (e.g. older adult, have chronic illnesses or are immunocompromised), reconsider the need to be present in a large crowd and perhaps find a way to participate virtually. I would also add that if you have a vulnerable person in your household, you should also consider participating virtually. And if you are sick, please stay home.   Last week, we launched the   to provide up-to-date information on core indicators for local monitoring and informing reopening decisions. This public dashboard, which is updated daily, will hopefully help residents better understand the situation and the impact of their actions. Each of us matter and each of us will help determine the trajectory of the number of infections in our community and the opportunity for more businesses and settings to re-open. As more places open, it is easy to think the virus has gone away. But it remains in our community. So, when you are in a public setting (indoors or outdoors), it is important to maintain physical distancing of at least two metres and wear a cloth mask when necessary. The more we start to gather in public again with the opening of businesses and outdoor spaces, the more mindful we must be of our actions as we learn to live with COVID-19 in our community. When outdoors, use caution when: In indoor settings, use caution and routinely apply the principles of physical distancing, mask use, and washing your hands before and after activities such as: View our   for additional information about red, least safe options and green, safer options. First, I would like to begin by expressing my condolences to the family and friends of the personal support worker who recently passed away from the Madonna Care Home. Our thoughts are with you. The Ottawa community has understood well the extraordinary measures required to avoid a health system catastrophe from COVID-19 infections increasing too quickly.  Because of Ottawans taking precautions, we are seeing results.  We can start to get back to work and access more services.  Thank you for continuing to observe recommendations through this challenging time.   The Champlain Health Region Incident Command (CHRIC) oversees COVID-19 testing centres and the Eastern Ontario Laboratory Association.  Ottawa Public Health (OPH) is working with CHRIC to continue to adjust the COVID-19 testing strategy to balance demand for tests with laboratory capacity and ensure testing follows identified priorities. Tests are completed in three general categories in Ottawa and across the province. First, for public health purposes related to case and contact management and controlling outbreaks. When someone tests positive for COVID-19, OPH conducts contact tracing to identify contacts at risk for infection to stop the chain of transmission. In addition to self-isolation or self-monitoring of contacts, testing is used to identify those who may have become infected. When there is an outbreak in a congregate setting or workplace, staff and residents with the closest contact are tested, but depending upon the scenario, individuals on one floor or in the entire setting  are tested as part of disease control actions.   Second, ongoing “surveillance” testing occurs in congregate settings. CHRIC and OPH are taking a risk-based approach so that congregate settings that face greater challenges to infection prevention and control complete testing more frequently. The frequency and approach will be further defined by the province. The last category of testing is of the broader public that may be at risk of infection with COVID-19. People who have COVID-19-like symptoms are a priority for testing as soon as possible after symptoms appear.  The testing of more asymptomatic  people may provide more information about the geographic distribution of infections and hopefully help identify sources of exposure in the community to enable action to stop transmission. Any Ottawa resident who feels they need a test, even if they are not showing symptoms, can present for testing. In addition to the  , some family doctors’ offices are providing this service, and mobile services are available for populations with need by referral. OPH still recommends using the   if you are worried you were exposed to COVID-19 or have symptoms. With workplaces increasingly reopening, OPH is encouraging daily screening of everyone working in the workplace by asking people if they have symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough, sore throat or cold symptoms. Symptomatic people should go home, self-isolate and seek COVID-19 testing.  Tests are currently being turned around in about a day. Screening tools are available on OPH’s businesses and workplaces webpage at ottawapublichealth.ca. OPH encourages individuals to seek medical care if feeling unwell by contacting your healthcare provider.   As we adapt to living with COVID-19, controlling the rate of transmission and the number of cases will help keep this virus under control. Only a few cases at the beginning of the pandemic in Ottawa required us to ramp up public health measures. At that time, the number of infections was doubling every three to four days.   Until there is a vaccine or an effective treatment, while there is COVID-19 infection in Ottawa, public health advice includes practicing physical distancing, hand hygiene, wearing a cloth mask when physical distancing is not possible and limiting your contacts; all these measures are going to be part of our new normal. Warm weather has finally arrived, businesses are reopening and more people are going back to work. This is good for our mental health and the economy, and we need to be wise with our actions as we continue to live with COVID-19. I’m happy to see more people wearing masks when out in public places. This shows that people are getting the message to wear a mask when physical distancing may not be possible. This will become our new normal as the city reopens. Remember: my mask protects you and your mask protects me. We are following the provincial framework to reopen which includes monitoring four dimensions: virus spread and containment, health care system capacity, public health behaviours and testing and tracing capacity. Questions are arising about what is permissible and what is not as provincial orders change and many provincial restrictions remain in place.  Please continue to use the principle of protecting yourselves and others as you choose activities. Examples of high-risk activities include having guests over, going to crowded places and participating in team or contact sports. Low-risk activities include going to less-crowded beaches or parks, enjoying a hobby alone like bird watching or shopping online with home delivery or curbside pickup options (preferably locally). I know Ottawa is a resilient city. We’ve been through challenges before. And we’ve always worked together to address them and come out on the other side. I am saddened, disturbed and concerned about what was reported in the Canadian Armed Forces report (OP Laser – JTFC Observations in long-term care facilities in Ontario). I am supportive of the Ontario government’s immediate action to investigate further in long-term care homes (LTCH) across the province. Everyone deserves proper care and a safe home. OPH is continuing to work with healthcare partners to provide infection prevention and control (IPAC) support LTCH to control COVID-19 in our community. Homes in outbreak are contacted almost daily and regular on-site visits enable direct assessment of IPAC practices in the homes. Every LTCH and retirement home is rated every day in terms of needs for support, whether for IPAC training or supplies, and as it relates to staffing. In other cities, the military has been brought in when staffing levels could not be met. Here in Ottawa, LTCHs in greatest need have been paired with hospitals and the Champlain Health Region Incident Command (CHRIC) monitors how hospitals are meeting staffing requests of homes, as well as works to build capacity of homes to hire needed support. The LTCH regulator’s inspectors have been kept informed about work underway in Ottawa-based homes. We are currently experiencing our first heatwave of this summer, which will be challenging in a different way this year. Heat warnings mean extra precautions need to be taken by everyone. Some of the usual ways we cool off are not yet available this summer because of measures put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Please think ahead and plan for ways to stay cool and keep in touch with others who may not be able to stay cool, especially during a heat warning. Some ways to protect yourself and help others during hot weather: The City of Ottawa has set up four emergency cooling centres to provide relief from the heat to residents in need. The emergency cooling centers are set up to ensure users can practice proper physical distancing and will have access to washrooms and water. Residents should bring a cloth mask with them to the cooling centres if they have one. Emergency cooling centres will be open Tuesday, May 26 from 3 pm to 7 pm, and will operate on Wednesday, May 27 and Thursday May 28 from 11 am to 7 pm.  We expect this heat wave to subside by end of day Thursday. The emergency cooling centres are located at the following City facilities:  Visit OPH’s   for more information. OPH continues to follow guidance provided by the Ontario Ministry of Health regarding testing. Any Ottawa resident who feels they need a test, even if they are not showing symptoms, can present for testing. Note that this may lead to longer waits to access testing if many people show up. In addition to the  s, some family doctors’ offices are providing this service, and mobile services are available for populations with need. OPH still recommends using the   if you are worried you were exposed to COVID-19 or have symptoms. We continue to work with healthcare partners to ensure this increased testing capacity is best used to find out where the virus is in the community and break chains of transmission. Unfortunately, as is often the case during a difficult time, we are seeing that mental health concerns and issues are on the rise, perhaps exacerbated because residents may not have access to their regular coping strategies. ​The Ottawa Distress Centre has seen a significant spike in calls for help to access mental health and addiction supports and for people in crisis. ​Increases in stress, anxiousness, sadness and loneliness have been highlighted from local service providers.   ​ ​OPH and our community and hospital partners have come together to better support residents. ​We are very proud of our partners supporting mental health and grateful for the work they have been doing. ​Some examples include the Royal Ottawa's C-PROMPT clinic providing ongoing counselling services, which received over 400 referrals since it launched on April 16, and the Royal's Health Care Worker Mental Health Clinic providing clinical services to healthcare workers and paramedics. ​The Ottawa Health Team and partner agencies, including OPH, are providing the Counselling Connect service for same-day or next-day phone or video counselling. And, as part of the Kids Come First Health Team, Youth Services Bureau (YSB) has modified their 24/7 crisis service to help youth and families get connected to the right Child and Youth Mental Health and Addictions service in Ottawa. ​​Visit OPH’s   for additional resources. I am pleased to share that when OPH contact tracers follow-up with COVID-19 positive cases, contacts per case dropped from approximately20 contacts to ​an average of five. This shows that people are being smart about distancing and helping to continue plank the curve. Despite this progress, we only have a small margin of safety if we want to continue to pin down the virus. If we increase our close contacts too widely and too quickly, the number of cases and outbreaks may rise sharply, which will put a burden on the health care system – something we have fortunately avoided so far. As we reopen and are no longer focusing on “just staying home,” we need to be smart about distancing, engaging in lower risk activities and learning to live with the virus. Keep protecting others by wearing a cloth mask when a two-metre distance cannot be kept and limiting your contacts. We are working with various partners to develop a supply of cloth masks for those who will have difficulty accessing or purchasing a mask. I hope to share more details as we finalize those details and partnerships. We’ve been exploring different measures to better convey how OPH is monitoring COVID-19’s spread in the community, which is especially important now that restrictions have begun to ease and the province is reopening. Today, we launched the   to provide this information to the public in a user-friendly format. We’ve introduced a colour-coding system to let people know what is the bottom-line. On a scale from red, orange, yellow and green, we are currently in the orange category. The colour rating is based on our public health and health system capacity, our ability to test and track the virus and on current spread in the community. This new public dashboard, which will be updated daily, will hopefully help residents better understand the situation and the impact of their actions. Each of us matter and each of us will help determine the trajectory of the number of infections in our community and our freedoms into the future. Thank you to everyone who practiced physical distancing over what was another beautiful weekend in Ottawa. Spending time in nature can have positive impacts on our mental health and the sunshine and warmer temperatures makes being outdoors much more enticing for many of us.  I want to continue to stress the importance that as we go about reopening Ottawa and resuming activities, we must do so in a smart way, which includes keeping our two metre distance from others and wearing a mask in close contact with people outside our households. The likelihood and severity of a second wave is largely determined by our actions; what we do today will impact our future freedoms.   Yesterday Premier Doug Ford stated that anyone in Ontario who is worried about having been exposed to COVID-19 can present for testing even if not showing symptoms. Ottawa Public Health (OPH) and the COVID-19 Assessment Centre & COVID-19 Care Clinics are awaiting further guidance provided by the Ontario Ministry of Health regarding testing.   Any Ottawa resident who feels they need a test, even if they are not showing symptoms of illness, can now go for testing at the COVID-19 Assessment Centre or the COVID-19 Care Clinics and should not be turned away unless volumes are significant.  Populations at highest risk for COVID-19 transmission like healthcare workers and people with symptoms of illness will need to be prioritized if demand outstrips capacity.  The available test detects COVID-19 virus in the body, not antibodies, so the test cannot tell you if you have had COVID-19 infection in the past.  Since yesterday’s provincial announcement, we have seen increased numbers of individuals presenting for testing at the COVID-19 Assessment Centre and COVID-19 Care Clinics. If you do present for testing, please be prepared for longer wait times and wear a mask if you are able to do so. When wait times are significant, priority will be given to residents from high-risk groups and those showing symptoms.   Our website has been updated to reflect this change in testing: please see   for more details. We expect a formal testing strategy to be announced by the ministry later this week.  In addition to the COVID-19 Assessment Centre and Care Clinics, some family doctors offices are providing this service, and mobile services are available for populations with need. We will be announcing further options for accessing COVID19 tests in the future.I am pleased that our labs have been able to increase testing capacity. As it stands, the Champlain region is able to process approximately 1,900 tests per day. We are working with healthcare partners to ensure this increased testing capacity is best used tofind out where the virus is in the community and break chains of transmission, with a focus on populations at highest risk.   For more information on testing, please visit  .  We’ve been asked about the number of cases rising in Ontario and whether it really is the right time to be reopening. At this point, increases in cases are mostly in the Greater Toronto Area, not in Ottawa.   We will continue to monitor the situation locally and inform the public; people need to know what is happening where they live.  Last Friday, Dr. Doug Manuel shared a cautionary note on reopening: while everyone in Ottawa has contributed to flattening the curve, we cannot move forward as though the virus is gone.  We still have outbreaks and a stable level of hospitalizations in Ottawa. We must find ways to live with this virus.  Our goal is to resume activities in a way that decreases risk of transmission – keeping distance between ourselves and supporting businesses’ employees’ health and protecting others by wearing masks when within two metres of someone.  Hot weather has come early this year in Ottawa and southern Ontario. To reduce the burden on our health care system, I want to remind residents of ways to prevent heat-related illnesses.     Heat and high humidity can be difficult to deal with, especially for people at risk such as older adults, infants, outdoor workers and people with pre-existing health conditions.   Ottawa Public Health is encouraging residents to get ready for the heat by having a plan on how they will stay cool and prevent heat related illnesses.  With many of our usual places to cool off not open right now, such as libraries, pools and shopping malls we will have to rely on other means to cool off.    Cool water and the use of fans or air conditioning are two very effective ways of staying cool. Some good reminders to prevent heat related illnesses include:  For more information visit  .  Hot weather concerns and face masks:  Wearing a mask is important to decrease transmission of COVID-19 in any indoor setting where it may be difficult to maintain at least two-metre distancing or the room or corridor is small. Wearing a mask may not be necessary outdoors (where higher temperatures may be more of a concern) if distances can be maintained.  Masks do become more uncomfortable in hot temperatures, but they will still work. The general public should plan outdoor outings for the coolest times of the day and take breaks in the shade or a cool environment if they are finding a face mask uncomfortable in the heat.    For people undertaking physical exertion in heat, a mask can make the effort more difficult. Decreasing intensity/volume of work, more frequent rests, and more cooling breaks may be necessary. Discuss your health needs with your employer.  This week is Paramedic Services Week, an opportunity to recognize the invaluable work these frontline workers commit to every day.  Our paramedics are on the front lines during this fight against COVID-19 and have played an integral role in responding to and preventing the spread of COVID-19.  On behalf of Ottawa Public Health, thank you Ottawa paramedics for being there to help protect the health and well-being of all Ottawa residents.   At the end of this first week of reopening, and as the warmer weather appears to be here to stay, many people may be feeling like we have entered a new phase of this pandemic, and they would be correct. And, now is not the time to ease up on our efforts that have been keeping this virus pinned down. We are still learning how we can live with COVID-19 in our community while continuing to do some of the activities that we enjoy. I can’t say enough that we must continue to keep physical distancing and wear a cloth mask in situations when we can’t keep a two-metre distance from others outside our household.  These activities prevent infections. We are still in this together as a community to protect ourselves and others.    As we resume some of our usual activities and routines like shopping or grabbing take-out coffee, perhaps seeing others we have not seen in a long time at that two-meter distance, you may experience a variety of emotions. I for one got a little emotional yesterday when I saw the usual person serving in the coffee shop down the street when it reopened after two months. This is normal during times of stress and uncertainty and when we see signs of overcoming adversity.  Thank you so much for your efforts in the first phase of the pandemic response and for your resilience to continue your hard work and share ideas on how we can live within this new normal.    Testing to detect as many COVID19 infections in our community as we can is another one of the efforts that will help keep the virus pinned down as we begin to reopen Ottawa.  I’d like to remind everyone that testing is now available to anyone with suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Many family physicians’ offices are open, so please check with them first.  And, the assessment centre, care clinics and laboratories have the capacity to offer this testing for everyone that needs it.  By getting tested, you are helping us find every case we can to stop transmission of COVID-19; this information helps us to detect cases more quickly, understand what transmission is occurring in the community, investigate potential sources and identify outbreaks earlier.    The testing strategy continues to evolve based on the needs of the community, testing capacity as well as provincial guidance. Currently, discussions are underway about in what situations it makes sense to test people who are asymptomatic. We currently test people who are asymptomatic in situations of outbreaks in congregate care settings.  Ottawa’s testing capacity has grown significantly since the declaration of the virus in Canada, but we still do not have the capacity to test everyone in Ottawa. We’re working closely with our healthcare, provincial and federal partners to best use our testing capacity.  We encourage employers and organizations to consider using a screening questionnaire available on OPH’s website that your staff and volunteers can use to self-assess for COVID-19 symptoms before starting their work day. Any employees with even mild symptoms should not work when ill and are strongly encouraged to present for testing. I know that testing gets a lot of attention, but prevention is essential and has always been a key focus for the work of public health. We would much rather prevent cases of COVID-19 in our community than chase the virus down once it starts spreading. We know that prevention saves the health care system dollars, but it also saves lives.  Not getting sick in the first place is better for everyone, particularly when there is no effective cure for the infection.  Early public health advice to practice physical distancing has prevented transmission in our community, and I thank all of you who continue to practice preventive measures such as physical distancing, washing your hands frequently, not touching your face and wearing a cloth mask when in close contact with people outside your household.  Testing is not enough.  These measures are important to continue to limit transmission in the community.     Connecting with people with confirmed COVID-19 and their contacts, to support them to do their part to manage their illness and decrease further transmission, is another essential public health measure in place to help keep the virus pinned down as we begin to reopen Ottawa. When OPH is notified of a confirmed case of COVID-19, we call the individual within 24 hours and begin the process of contact tracing. Through our case and contact management work, OPH is seeing that the number of close contacts per case is now often less than five and contacts are usually household contacts. Before physical distancing and self-isolation measures were introduced, OPH was notifying approximately 15 to 20 close contacts per case. We will continue to monitor the impact of reopening and how this influences the number of close contacts per case. Modelling shows that in Ottawa, if contacts rise by even 20 per cent, we can anticipate to see hospitalizations increase.    I encourage everyone to get outside and enjoy this beautiful weather. Please keep doing what you're doing to limit your total contacts: stay two metres apart, wash your hands and wear a cloth mask when you can’t keep physical distance. Your actions are appreciated and will be what allows us to live in a more sustainable way in the future.    As we start our long weekend, we hope all residents can take some time to enjoy the weather and being outdoors. Please remember to continue to stay two metres away from people who do not live in your household, and if you are in public places where you cannot maintain this two metre distance, please wear a non-medical cloth mask if possible. As some businesses and public spaces reopen, there are increased opportunities for interacting with others, so there is a greater chance of the virus spreading. Our message remains the same: the less people you come into contact with, the better to keep COVID-19 pinned down. We are still  in a pandemic situation. We trust that the people of Ottawa will continue to be vigilant to protect themselves and others. Although we are seeing some positive signs, such as the number of cases and deaths decreasing and hospitalization rates stabilizing, the virus has not left our community. We want to prevent a second wave of the virus, because if infections increase rapidly our healthcare system could be overwhelmed, more people will die, and businesses will potentially suffer from having to scale back again.    The daily case numbers continue to show that there is community spread of the virus - cases that we cannot attribute to direct contact of a confirmed case or travel. For example we have had 1,753 cases, with about half (52%) acquired in institutions. But, as for the situation in the community, there were 20% from known close contacts and approximately 20% are community acquired cases where the individual could not identify the source of the virus. Contributing to this situation is that people can be asymptomatic and still spread the virus. With a lot of focus on long-term care homes, I believe people are starting to think that the virus is only occurring in those homes. This is not the case.  We are strongly encouraging everyone who has symptoms that could be COVID-19 to self-isolate and to present for assessment, even if the symptoms are mild, so we can track down the sources of infection in the community and break chains of transmission. We do not know how long we will live with COVID-19 in the community, so we have to find healthy ways to cope in this new reality. Please stay home if you are ill, continue washing your hands, disinfecting shared surfaces, and wearing a non-medical mask when physical distancing is not possible. As more businesses and public spaces reopen in Ottawa, all of us have a role to play – Ottawa Public Health, residents, our partners, and businesses.  Some of the key roles for public health are to: OPH announced on Wednesday that testing is now available to everyone with suspected COVID-19 symptoms. The province also followed with this announcement yesterday for all Ontarians. It is essential for us to identify people with COVID-19 infections and follow-up with them quickly to provide information and the importance of self-isolating and to identify their close contacts, so that they can also self-isolate. This management of cases and their contacts is one of the essential public health measures in place to help keep the virus pinned down as we begin to reopen Ottawa. Again, we encourage anyone with symptoms to go for testing. You can now be assessed for testing at both the Assessment Centre and Care Clinics; they have the capacity for this increased testing.  People have asked us why they should go for testing, especially if their symptoms are mild and they are managing okay at home. By getting tested, you are helping us find every case we can to stop the transmission; this information helps us to detect cases more quickly, understand what transmission is occurring in the community, investigate the source, and identify outbreaks earlier.       COVID-19 Support Teams have continued outreach to long-term care homes (LTCH) identified by public health as “red,” or high risk. Homes flagged as “yellow” (i.e. moderate risk) are also being engaged for outreach. Health-care teams in the Champlain Health Region successfully tested residents in all 60 local LTCH ahead of the provincial government’s May 15 deadline. Over the last three weeks more than 7,000 residents and 8,000 staff have been tested by teams comprised of hospital staff, public health, and paramedics. Meeting this testing mandate reflects a tremendous effort by our regional partners. We would like to take the opportunity to thank the Brewer Assessment Centre staff, the Queensway Carleton Hospital, Hopital Montfort, and the Ottawa Paramedic Service for their commitment to supporting LTCH in the Champlain Region. A number of partnerships between hospitals and LTCH have now been established to support staffing needs, and more continue to be established as assessments continue. Retirement homes are being included in our outreach model, and are being categorized with the same colour criteria as LTCH. The “tier two” escalation process that has been established for regional support if a hospital is unable to adequately staff its partner long-term care home(s) is being tracked daily (see example below). The province has announced the plan to gradually reopen some businesses and public spaces. By slowly reopening, we will be better able to assess and monitor any increases in transmission of the virus within the community, and hopefully reduce the impact of any outbreaks. OPH has links to the province’s recommended guidelines for businesses and workplaces on our website to help guide reopening in a way that considers the health and safety of both employees and customers.  We will be monitoring the impact of the reopening of businesses and other easing of COVID-19 restrictions. As these changes increase our interactions with others, there is an increased risk of infection rates rising.  We have to stay vigilant and continue to practice physical distancing and limiting the total number of people that we come in contact with; these are what have flattened the curve and kept demands on hospital capacity manageable so far. Recommended physical distancing measures don’t change with reopening. Thank you to the people of Ottawa for your hard work and efforts to protect our community.  I’ve already spoken about what to do if you’re feeling ill. We also want everyone to continue your efforts to lower the chance that you will spread the virus unknowingly to someone else or that someone will give it to you. When you are outside your home, we recommend that you protect yourself and others by: Wearing a mask is new for many people, but we have already seen this happening in our community. When more people wear a mask, especially as more businesses and public spaces reopen, wearing masks is one element that allows a city to control spread of transmission, get control of the disease, and have more freedom. We know that some individuals who are infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, and wearing a mask limits their ability to infect others. If you are wearing a mask, you are caring for others. As Chair Egli said at yesterday’s town hall: “My mask protects you, and your mask protects me.” There is information on our website about where to get a non-medical mask and how to wear and wash a mask. We also launched a mask contest today on   (Ottawa Public Health’s youth-focused Instagram), to encourage youth to embrace proper mask use and come up with fun and quirky names for masks.  We also recently connected with residents through an online survey and the results give us increased confidence that the people of Ottawa are committed to continue to follow public heath guidance and protect each other. 94 percent of respondents said they will continue to practice physical distancing even as some restrictions are relaxed. And almost 90 per cent of respondents said they would be willing to wear a non-medical mask in public to be allowed to access more services. Lastly, I would like to remind residents that we want to hear your thoughts, perceptions, and understanding of current restrictions in place related to COVID-19. You can share your feedback through our online platform at engage.ottawa.ca/covid19. Thank you again for your community response to this pandemic. Enjoy the long weekend, just two metres apart! As we continue to see the number of cases of COVID-19 in the community decline, I want to thank Ottawa residents for your efforts to follow public health messaging. I continue to be touched and proud to be a part of this community that has come together and shown such great support for each other during these unprecedented times. We have reached the next phase in the capacity for COVID19 testing in Ottawa. Ottawa Public Health (OPH) now recommends that anyone experiencing any   should be tested. Those with symptoms can be assessed by a healthcare provider, and tested, if required, at the  or one of the  . If wait times are high, priority will be given to essential workers and healthcare workers. Many primary care offices remain open to assess patients as well, so please call your family physician’s office to see if they can accommodate your visit first. As usual, the advice to stay home when ill is important to stop the spread of infections.  When traveling to access an assessment centre, care clinic or other healthcare setting, please use a non-medical mask or face covering and keep your hands clean. If you are in distress (e.g. significant trouble breathing, chest pain, fainting, or have a significant worsening of any chronic disease symptoms), do not go to the assessment centre or a care clinic. Go to the nearest emergency department or call 9-1-1. As of yesterday, testing has been completed in Ottawa’s 28 long-term care homes and 76 staff have been tested in the three emergency childcare centers in Ottawa. ​At the moment, there is no plan to expand the surveillance testing to other settings, however OPH has proactively reached out to retirement homes that need support with our healthcare partners. And, supports to other congregate care settings, like group homes and shelters, continue to evolve. COVID‐19 Support Teams have continued outreach to long‐term care homes identified by public health​ as ‘high risk’ and homes flagged as moderate risk are also being engaged. A number of partnerships between hospitals and long‐term care homes have been established to support staffing and other needs in the homes. These interventions are making a difference and more partnerships are established as assessments continue. ​ As we adapt to living with COVID-19 and begin to reopen our city, we are working with residents, community and health care partners and all levels of government to ensure new and expanded measures are in place: more widespread testing of symptomatic people, technology to support case and contact management and universal face covering where physical distancing is not possible. We have asked for your thoughts, perceptions and understanding of current restrictions in place related to COVID-19 through various feedback mechanisms including our   engagement platform. We are asking respondents what they are doing to make physical distancing more manageable and so far, have received many ideas on reopening the city. We have heard about mask use, expanded testing, and how businesses can operate while ensuring people maintain a safe distance from each other. This information is helping to inform decision makers and we encourage all residents to continue sharing their experiences with us. Since launching the COVID-19 online engagement on May 1 we have heard from more than 1500 residents through our surveys and ideas tool. The first phase closes soon but there is still time to have your say: visit  . ​​The actions we have collectively taken to date - and will continue to take – will impact our future. Earlier in the year, I referenced several p-words related to what we were just learning was a pandemic - including preparedness, prevention and politeness. I have a few more words to add. Let’s continue to be proactive and pragmatic. We need to help people get back to work and we can work to prevent a resurgence with maintaining physical distancing and wearing non-medical masks or face coverings when within 2 metres of others. Thank you for your patience, your perseverance and your passion. Today marks the start of  , a time when nurses are recognized for their hard work, dedication and commitment to the health and well-being of us all. Ottawa Public Health (OPH) nurses play a vital role across the Ottawa community and in the life of every resident in the city. As respected members of our public health teams, nurses bring tremendous technical expertise to promote and protect our community's health and to prevent disease and injury across populations. During this week, please join me in extending a thank you to the OPH nurses and all nurses across the healthcare sector for their tireless work now and every day. OPH continues to work with the Champlain Health Region Incident Command (CHRIC) to make COVID-19 testing available to the public, carry out testing to manage outbreaks and a surveillance exercise in long-term care homes and emergency child care centres. The Ontario-area laboratories appear to be managing the volume of testing created from encouraging people over 60 who have COVID-19-like symptoms to present to an Assessment Centre or Care Clinic for assessment.  As the surveillance exercise wraps up, more of the population will be encouraged to present to rule out COVID-19 if they have symptoms of the infection. There have been many questions in the last few days regarding gathering with people outside our households if the group size is less than five. While Ontario regulation allows gatherings of up to five people, OPH recommends keeping to activities with members of our households as much as possible, no matter what the size of the group. If we increase our interaction with others too much too soon, the level of infection has more chances to rise and we may risk overburdening our health care system – something we have avoided so far, thanks to the actions of people in Ottawa.  People may not realize they are infected and still pass on the COVID-19 virus.  There are still cases arising in the community where people infected were not in contact with a known case and did not have a history of travel to an affected area. Some good news for everyone to access more outdoor space for walking, biking, hiking, and more to stay active and healthy: as of today, the provincial government will begin reopening provincial parks and conservation reserves for day use with limited access. Before planning your trip, please visit   to check the status of your local provincial park. Also, it is important to remember to continue to practice physical distancing if you decide to use these areas. Lastly, masks can provide another level of protection to people around you if you are not able to maintain a 2-metre distance from them. Today, I ‘d like to take a moment to recognize the local health care worker who died as a result of COVID-19, while working to protect the health of others. The family, friends and colleagues of the worker are in our thoughts.  It is very difficult to lose a member of the health care community, and we are devasted by this loss on top of the loss of so many residents. Long-term care homes OPH continues to be concerned for our residents in long-term care during this pandemic. It is important for the population, and especially those with loved ones in long-term care homes, to know that most long-term care homes in Ottawa have no outbreaks and zero cases of COVID-19. For those homes that do have outbreaks, hospitals have been paired up with the homes facing the greatest pressure and the situation has improved in the operation of these homes.  We continue to see deaths from infections that started with transmission in the past.  Managing risk while easing restrictions This week marked the start of easing some of the COVID-related community restrictions, such as the reopening of some parks and businesses, and more announcements are being made by the province frequently. Although more public spaces are available, the community remains extremely vulnerable to a resurgence of disease. Most people are not immune to COVID-19 and the vast majority of the population remains susceptible.  Therefore, we must continue to practice physical distancing as some measures are being relaxed – that message does not change.  And, I am encouraged that the motivation of the people of Ottawa to protect others around them will not change.  We are in the fortunate position in that we are able to observe what other countries are doing with regards to relaxation of restrictions and we will continue to monitor how the situations develop as they reopen their businesses, schools and outdoor spaces. We are in a time where people need to, and they want to, return to the activities they love. OPH recognizes the burden that COVID-19 has created and the impacts on the direct health of Ottawa’s residents. And, we are concerned about the indirect harms COVID19 has caused -- stress and anxiety, loss of employment, food insecurity, exposure to violence, delayed access to medical and dental services and reduced social support -- as these have big influences on health and wellbeing.  OPH is working with provincial, municipal and community partners to support a progressive relaxing of restrictions that will minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19 in the community.  If we increase our interaction with others too much too soon, the level of infection will rise and we risk overburdening our health care system – something we have avoided so far, thanks to your actions.  We need to continue to keep this virus pinned down and at a manageable level within the community, and I would like to also see a further decline in hospitalizations to show we are reaching lower levels of virus in the community.  What is important is that the actions of everyone in the city will be what determines our future. What you have done so far, and what we do today will impact our future. The people of Ottawa have done such a good job at protecting themselves and others by following the physical distancing measures.  We need to continue physical distancing moving forward as we resume other activities. During this period, wearing of cloth masks in the community when you cannot maintain a physical distance of two metres will be important to reduce transmission from individuals that do not have symptoms and may not realize they are ill. As well as, continued community testing of people with COVID19-like symptoms will be essential, along with testing to control outbreaks. OPH will continue to work with health care sector partners to ensure testing capacity.  Please continue to visit our website   for updated content about where to purchase a mask, how to wear a mask and updated physical distancing information. The Ottawa community has come together and has shown such great support for each other in these hard times. This week is the annual Mental Health Week that recognizes the importance of mental health awareness in Canada. As we face the COVID-19 pandemic, we need each other now more than ever. Being honest and clear about our needs, and how we are doing with regards to our mental health is of utmost importance, so that we can continue to support each other. There are resources available on   that you can use to support family, friends, colleagues and yourself. OPH is transitioning to a new case management and reporting system. In the interim, a condensed epidemiological report is posted on   until the transition is complete. We appreciate the public’s patience with this process. What is important to highlight regarding the data is that the level of hospitalizations is not in steep decline and that gives us an idea of infection in the community.    This means that while we have seen success in planking the curve, we have to remember that the level of infection in the community is simply being kept at a manageable level. There continues to be a risk, that as we increase our interactions with others, that the level of infection in our community will rise quickly again.  Surveillance testing for all residents and staff in 28 long-term care homes in Ottawa continues. Testing has occurred in 15 homes to-date, with testing in all homes to be completed on, or ahead of schedule, before May 15, 2020. This surveillance has included testing of approximately 1,880 residents and 1,826 staff with results still pending from multiple homes. This undertaking has only been possible with the collaborative effort of many partners: With all of the interest in testing, it is important to place surveillance testing in the overall context of controlling transmission of this disease. The purpose of this surveillance testing is to provide a snapshot of the current state of COVID-19 infections in long-term care homes particularly, since we know people can have mild or no symptoms and still be infectious. While the surveillance testing provides a picture of what's happening at one moment in time, infection, prevention, and control measures continue to be the most effective ways to decrease COVID-19 in long-term care homes. This includes employees avoiding working if symptomatic, ensuring all employees wear a medical grade face mask at all times while at work, and proper cohorting of people infected with COVID-19. To date, our COVID-19 engagement survey has almost 8,500 visits to the platform, 1,236 users have participated in the survey, and we’ve received over 115 ideas on how to make physical distancing more manageable. From what we’ve heard so far, the restrictions that have been especially difficult for residents include the closure of parks, reduced family and social connectedness, physical distancing requirements, and the closing of schools and childcare. Residents are encouraged to visit   to complete the survey in English and French and provide feedback. The feedback received will help the City and OPH develop a recovery plan that meets the needs and expectations of our community, as much as possible. There have been questions about masks over the past few days, and you may be seeing more people wearing material masks in the community. Someone wearing a mask is sending a signal that they care for you. Because of the risk of rising rates of infection again, OPH recommends that residents continue to maintain physical distancing of 2 metres from others, and to wear a non-medical mask when this distance cannot be maintained, such as on public transit or at a grocery store, to decrease transmission of COVID-19. For more information about non-medical masks, including how to make one or where to buy one, please visit our special  .  We know COVID-19 is circulating in our community and that transmission can occur when a person is asymptomatic. Wearing a non-medical mask is not a replacement for physical distancing, hand washing, and monitoring your health. We are seeing more people biking with their families on multiuse paths and joggers are seen alongside the river, this is good to see people outside and being active. City parks and beaches are partially reopening, and we hear that people want to spend time with family and friends outside their household. OPH continues to advise that limiting activities to members of your own household remains important to limit the spread of COVID-19 and save lives.  Physical distancing of at least two metres from non-household members needs to be maintained as we begin to open some public spaces. Thank you to Ottawa residents for all the efforts you have put into date. You ARE making a difference. Physical distancing is working but we can’t let up. Limiting outings to essential trips only is working. We all need to continue to do these things, so that we can be confident in moving forward with relaxing current restrictions. We will get through this time together. Stay connected, but stay physically apart. Stay healthy and Stay safe. Today I am pleased to announce that Ottawa Public Health and the City of Ottawa are launching the first phase of a city-wide engagement opportunity to hear from residents about our collective community response to COVID-19. We are looking to learn more about your thoughts, perceptions and understanding of current restrictions in place related to COVID-19. This online engagement platform, called  , will allow us to learn how residents are making changes in their lives to protect themselves and loved ones, what their experience has been receiving and understanding information, what kinds of supports residents have accessed, ideas to maintain physical distancing into the future and what is perhaps much needed right now – good news stories. The City and OPH are currently exploring how we can safely reopen the city in a gradual, phased approach while aligning with the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening the province, and we must include public feedback. The information we receive from residents will help to ensure we develop a plan for the post-peak period that aligns with the province and meets the needs and expectations of our community as much as possible.  OPH is also working with stakeholders, such as the Mayor’s office and City leadership, City task forces, health system partners, the NCC and others, to interpret and apply the anticipated provincial guidelines within Ottawa. Community and client engagement is one of the transformational initiatives in OPH’s strategic plan. Engagement is a process to work with our community, not just for our community, and ensures the decisions we make, and the work that we do, is rooted in the voices of clients and partners. I encourage everyone to visit   or   to participate in English and French. Please check back regularly as we will update this page to seek ongoing feedback as we continue to navigate next steps. One other way that OPH regularly engages with our residents is through Facebook. This week we launched another moderated Facebook page, called Aging Well in Ottawa for residents 55 years of age and older and their caregivers. This page has had a lot of interest in its first week.  Ottawa Public Health staff will be online from 9 am to 3 pm daily (Monday to Friday) to discuss timely health topics, address questions and support residents to connect with one another. Please join us online for this exciting new initiative. OPH is now recommending that any residents over 60 years of age experiencing any signs or symptoms of COVID-19, go for assessment.  The full list of who is eligible for testing is available on our website.  You can get tested at a   or a  . If you are in distress (e.g. significant trouble breathing, chest pain, fainting, or have a significant worsening of any chronic disease symptoms), do not go to the Assessment Centre or a COVID-19 Care clinic. Go to the nearest Emergency Department or call 9-1-1. OPH is transitioning to a new case management and reporting system called the COVID-19 Ottawa Database. This transition will position OPH to better manage COVID-19 case volumes, facilitate remote work options for the case management team and continue to uphold provincial reporting obligations. To support the transition, OPH is currently conducting quality assurance to validate the data in the new system. In the interim, a snapshot report will be posted until the transition is complete, likely early next week.  As of 4 pm on April 28, 2020, OPH is investigating 1,297 lab-confirmed cases, 76 newly reported since yesterday. Over the last few days, we have been seeing these larger increases in the number of cases than previous weeks. We anticipated this increase as more people are eligible for testing and therefore getting tested and due to the surveillance exercise that took place last weekend in which all staff and residents of nine long-term care homes were tested. Sadly, we are reporting five new deaths, all in long-term care residents, since our last report yesterday. Of the 76 deceased total, 69 (91 per cent) were aged 65 years or older, six were 45-64 years old and one was 20 to 44 years old; 39 males and 37 females. It is important to note that our reporting does not reflect the number of cases or deaths in a single day; but rather reflects the number of new cases since the last report which can include data from a range of days.  For example, the 76 cases reported today were from specimens collected April 24-27 and the 5 deaths reported today also occurred April 24-27. The number of reported confirmed cases is always just a percentage of the number of actual infections (symptomatic and symptomatic) in our community because testing capacity has only been extended to priority groups to date. Therefore, it is important that we all continue to keep physical distance from people outside of our households.  We are working with our health care partners to implement more testing for more of the population and continue our contact tracing to better understand the spread of the virus in our community. The majority of new confirmed cases have been in healthcare institutional outbreaks, but there continues to be community transmission (Figure 3).  Our reported data may differ from other numbers published elsewhere, such as care homes themselves, due to data entry lag, different reporting sources, or download times. Care homes get the information of residents’ results first and take appropriate measures to isolate and care for their residents and staff. This week is National Immunization Awareness Week, an annual event held at the end of April to recognize the importance of immunization in Canada. Prevention is at the heart of what we do at Ottawa Public Health, and this global pandemic is a terrible reminder of how a virus can impact our lives when there is no vaccine.  Vaccines are a proven way to protect people and communities against very harmful and serious diseases such as measles, polio, tetanus and more. As researchers and scientists across the world continue to search for a vaccine against COVID19, I want to remind residents of the importance of maintaining physical distancing and also keeping up with   for yourselves and your loved ones. There are two great initiatives happening this week regarding immunizations:    Facebook has been a valuable platform for Ottawa Public Health to engage with families and residents over the past years. To build on this success, Ottawa Public Health launched a new   this week for residents 55 years of age and older and their caregivers. An Ottawa Public Health staff will be online from 9 am to 3 pm daily (Monday to Friday) and residents connect with one another. Please join us online for this exciting new initiative. Starting tomorrow, Ottawa Public Health will be transitioning to a new case management and reporting system. This new web-based secure system allows our team to more quickly and easily document each individual case investigation and share data with the provincial Ministry of Health. Due to the technicalities of this transition, there will be no epidemiology report published on our website on Thursday, April 30. No data will be missing or lost; the information from April 30 will be included in the May 1 report. Today the Ontario premier unveiled the province’s framework for gradually re-opening the economy. We will review the framework with our municipal and health care system partners and provide more information on what this means in Ottawa in the coming days. This past weekend, surveillance testing began in nine long-term care homes in Ottawa. This exercise was completed as part of the provincial directive announced last week to implement surveillance testing at long-term care homes. The Ottawa Paramedic Service deserves a big thanks for this weekend’s collaborative effort to implement the pilot surveillance testing of long-term care home staff and residents.  The task of testing over 1700 residents and healthcare workers could not have been completed without 26 Ottawa paramedics willing to help with taking swabs. I also want to thank our partners from the Champlain Health Region Incident Command and the Eastern Ontario Regional Laboratory Association for their efforts this weekend, working alongside Ottawa Public Health team members, who also have my thanks for continuing strenuous efforts to control COVID-19 in our community. This kind of collaboration with City, healthcare and public health workers makes me proud of the response in our area and is the way we will continue to work with an ongoing focus on supports for long-term care homes. We know that asymptomatic transmission can occur, and we can expect an increase in the number of detected cases in health care workers and residents as a result of this surveillance exercise. The purpose of this surveillance testing is to better understand the current state of COVID-19 infections in long-term care homes. While testing is important to provide a picture of what's happening at one moment in time, infection, prevention and control measures, including wearing a medical grade face mask at all times while at work, and proper cohorting of people infected with COVID-19, continue to be the most effective ways to decrease COVID-19 in long-term care homes. Lastly, with the weather warming up, many more people will be taking advantage of the outdoors for exercise, which is encouraged.  Physical activity and getting fresh air are important for our overall physical and mental wellness; I advise everyone who can go outside, to do so, in a safe way. It is important to take care of our mental and physical health. Our neighbourhood sidewalks, streets, and multiuse paths are all still available to get outside and get moving. For most people, it is okay to go out for a walk, run or ride your bike, as long as you can continue to practice physical distancing. Others may need to stay in their homes for their own safety and/or the safety of the community, like if you’ve recently returned from outside Canada, if you’ve come into close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 and individuals who have symptoms of COVID-19 – even if they are mild. Ottawa Public Health’s website has new information on staying safe while being physically active in our neighborhoods as well as questions to consider before going outside.  Visit our website for information to stay safe when doing these activities. Thank you to our entire community for all the actions taken – these actions matter. Take the time to go outside and enjoy the warmer weather while staying safe. I am proud of what the people of Ottawa have done to protect our community since the start of the COIVD-19 pandemic. So many people have been willing to protect others, care for others, and have stepped up to help others. This good will and hard work are appreciated, and will be needed as we continue to learn to live with COVID-19. I know I can trust Ottawa residents to continue doing what is needed to prevent an unmanageable increase in infections in our community into the future. Todays’ update focuses on some of the work that Ottawa Public Health is doing with different sectors, such as businesses, as we plan to safely move towards a way to live and work that is more sustainable in the long term, when the time is right.  OPH is working with the City’s Senior Leadership Team, members of the business community, various community services partners, and many other stakeholder groups to figure out the best way to gradually and safely move forward with COVID-19 in our community, following direction from the province of Ontario, in coordination with the federal government. We must ensure we continue to protect those people that are most vulnerable, such as residents in long-term care and retirement homes.  Relaxing of restrictions will take time – and we are not quite there yet. Protecting people has been the priority and will continue to be a priority. Most people are not immune to COVID-19. So, when we begin to relax measures and increase our interactions with other people, we expect there will be an increase in transmission of the virus. COVID-19 will be a part of our lives and how we live into the foreseeable future. We need to find a balance of risks and benefits of easing restrictions, including identifying what we can do to mitigate risks.  Members of the business community want to help ensure that the opening up of economic activity is done safely, so that businesses do not need to face closing a second time. Businesses are thinking about ways to operate differently to mitigate the risks of spreading COVID-19. For example, having more people working from home, changing the set-up in some offices and businesses, and considering ways for employees and customers to wear masks and have easy access to wash their hands will all help decrease COVID-19 transmission. The desire to move ahead carefully is consistent with the direction of the province. The Premier has said that any changes will be implemented in a phased approach. There will not be one date for everything to change and return to normal.    I appreciate the engagement with partners, stakeholders, and residents. We will work together as a community to inform how we will learn to live with COVID-19 in the coming months. Lastly, a reminder during current religious holidays, that physical distancing measures are still needed and the provincial emergency order in place requires people gather in groups of less than 6. I encourage you to find new ways to celebrate virtually with family and friends and to limit your contact to members of your own household as much as possible.  Yesterday, the   which shows the enhanced public health measures, including staying home and practicing physical distancing, are working to contain the spread of COVID-19 and flatten the curve. However, the Premier, Minister of Health and Canada’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, agree these measures must remain in place to continue reducing the number of cases and deaths. While this is strongly encouraging, it is too soon to say that we are currently peaking here in Ottawa. We are waiting for more evidence to show that COVID-19 is slowing down in our community, particularly based on the number of hospitalizations, which follow the rate of infection by about a week. While hospitalizations have stabilized over the last week, we want to see this number start to go down before we can confidently say COVID-19 has peaked in Ottawa. Therefore, I am asking residents to continue practicing physical distancing and to stay home except for essential trips, like for groceries and physical activity. What we’re doing is working but now is not the time to relax these measures and undo the hard-won progress we have made together. People living in long-term care homes, retirement homes and other congregate settings still need the protection provided by the community doing its part.  Healthcare workers still do not have as much personal protective equipment as they will need into the future.  And, the province is still working on building a surveillance system and testing strategy essential for monitoring the levels of infection in our community that could rise with relaxing restrictions. For the latest epidemiological data for Ottawa, visit our  . I know there has been evolving messaging about whether or not to wear a mask. If you are coughing or sneezing, wear a non-medical mask to protect people around you from getting sick. This is very important if you go to an appointment, clinic or a hospital. Do not go to other public places when you are sick, even if you are wearing a mask. If you are not sick or not displaying symptoms and are going to a public place (e.g., grocery store or pharmacy) wearing homemade masks or  face coverings  . Additionally, I’d like to remind residents that medical masks and N95 respirators should not be worn by healthy community members since they need to be protected for healthcare workers For more information on masks, please visit  . I continue to express my condolences to those who are impacted by the outbreaks in long-term care and retirement homes be it staff, residents or family members. I am encouraged by the way the government has enabled staffing levels to be addressed to ensure homes have enough support. OPH continues to work with healthcare partners to ensure long-term care and retirement homes are a top priority for protection. I get a lot of questions about testing in long-term care and retirement homes. When there is an outbreak in a home or congregate setting, all healthcare workers are tested regardless of whether they have symptoms. Close contacts of a positive case are also tested regardless of symptoms. And, testing is not the solution because regardless of the result, someone could be in the early stages of an infection or go on to become infected.   What is absolutely vital is using proper personal protective equipment, keeping cases isolated and consistently incorporating proper infection prevention and control measures. This is what will protect people the most and this is also the focus of OPH and our healthcare partners. I’d like to address how Ottawa Public Health investigates and follows up with each positive case of COVID-19. OPH has a mandate to follow up with all persons who test positive for COVID-19 as well as their close contacts. Each case is monitored on a daily basis, meaning my team will reach out to each positive case and their close contacts every day for 14 days to see how each person is doing, provide information and address questions and concerns. The reason it is so important to check in daily is so OPH can ensure cases and close contacts are following proper home isolation guidelines and to provide clear direction on what each individual should be doing to protect themselves and others. Additionally, this is a new disease so daily follow up is imperative in recording information on how the disease is progressing. I’d like to acknowledge my case management team who has undertaken this crucial undertaking. Consistent case follow up is one of the many things OPH is doing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community. Thank you for your collaboration in practicing physical distancing and for finding new and innovative ways of supporting each other including by providing donations and making homemade masks.  This is very important work that we encourage volunteers continue.  I want to thank the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario (RNAO) for their support during this crisis to significantly enhance our capacity with over 100 nurses for triaging, test results, case management and contact tracing.  Our City of Ottawa partners deserve recognition and thanks. Other City departments have been supporting our efforts in various ways, including the redeployment of resources to OPH and support of the Human Needs Task Force and the Business Task Force, among other things. Thanks also to  our healthcare system partners for their continued efforts to increase capacity, share resources, facilitate patient flow, and so many other aspects of this response. Lastly, I want to thank the media for their continued work in ensuring residents have accurate, timely information.  For an in-depth review of OPH’s work on the COVID-19 response to date, you can watch yesterday’s Board of Health meeting on  . Residents can also tune in to tomorrow’s City Council meeting on   or on Rogers TV.  - As the community continues to follow physical distancing recommendations from Ottawa Public Health, Ottawa area hospitals want to remind the public to continue to come to hospital if they think they have a serious health concern. We appreciate that the public is taking the recommendations to stay home so seriously, but it should not come at the cost of one’s health or safety. If you are in need of urgent medical attention, please go to your nearest Emergency Department or call 911 right away. Hospital staff are taking every necessary precaution to ensure the health and safety of our patients, caregivers, staff, and community. Our staff and medical staff are ready and able to care for you in the safest way possible. There are a number of clinical programs that continue to run and care for patients in need, in person and virtually. The   has maintained capacity to provide care for all cardiac emergencies. Please don’t ignore your heart symptoms. A delay in seeking care could have a lasting impact on the outcome of your treatment. It is important for all patients to keep in touch with their family doctor, and other specialists (like cardiologists) who manage their care. In select cases, a virtual or telephone consultation with one of our cardiologists may be appropriate. While we are all encouraged to stay home whenever possible, we understand that for some, home is not always a safe place. The Ottawa Hospital’s  , run out of the Civic Campus Emergency Department, is still here to care for patients who have experienced sexual or intimate partner violence. The program is offering virtual follow-up clinics, to provide access to care for those unable to come to the hospital. There are also sexual assault programs run out of   and  . Please contact the one closest to you. As the regional stroke centre, The Ottawa Hospital also wants to remind the public not to ignore the symptoms of a stroke at the first onset. Time is of the essence when treating any condition, especially a stroke. It’s important to seek medical attention immediately if you think you might be experiencing a stroke. We also know that increased stress and anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic can bring or worsen mental health and substance use issues. If you are struggling, please reach out for help. As many of you are aware, The Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre has opened an urgent access mental health clinic to help individuals who are at risk of declining mental health or hospitalization. The   is available with a referral from your primary care provider.   for any children or youth in need. While there are changes to some of the substance use services in our community, many programs are still offering services—but changing the way they are offered, such as offering virtual counselling. The Royal’s   is open and accepting new clients. This includes a Rapid Access Addiction Medicine Clinic that is providing services virtually during the pandemic. To access these substance use services at The Royal, call 613-722-6521 ext. 6508.     At  , many clinics are connecting virtually with children and youth who have existing relationships with the care teams there. However, CHEO has seen a 70 per cent drop in new cases of diabetes in the last 30 days, and those children and youth who have gone to the Emergency Department are sicker than is expected normally. And while CHEO unfortunately continues to see new cases of childhood cancer, some of these children and youth are only coming in to be seen after the symptoms have been around for longer than they would usually see. The COVID-19 Care Clinics in the west and east ends continue to provide treatment for individuals who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms of respiratory illness requiring a medical assessment, such as coughs, fever, and other cold-like symptoms. The clinic in the west end is operated by   staff, while the clinic in the east end is operated by   – both with the help of community primary care physicians and pediatricians. -- 30 -- Bruyère: Jesse Cressman Dickinson,  CHEO: Paddy Moore,  Montfort: Martin Sauvé,  Queensway Carleton Hospital: D.G.

Morris,  The Province has again increased the  : These expanded criteria will allow us to test more people and get a better sense of the potential scope of infection in our community. This is important into the future to enable more targeted strategies and the eventual relaxation of restrictions. I encourage everyone that meets these criteria testing to get tested. We are starting to see the testing numbers increase again. We know that this situation is taking a toll on people’s mental health. This was a common concern shared on Twitter this morning when I asked for  .  Everyone will experience this situation in their own way. It is completely natural to feel stress and concern during these times and so it is important to practice positive coping strategies. Our team has added various resources on the  , including a video on maintaining your mental health and a list of telephone, text or chat services. These may be helpful to you.

Also, in response to the COVID-19 situation, the   is offering phone and video counselling services. A lot of people have been asking if they should be wearing face coverings or masks when they do leave their home and go out into the community; this was also a common theme on the  . We know that there is some asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19; so if you cannot maintain physical distancing, wearing a mask helps to protect people you may come into contact with when you’re out in the community. It provides an added layer of protection. We continue to ask people to limit trips outside the home to essential needs such as for groceries, medicine or daily physical activity and to limit close contacts to members of their household. Thank you to the many residents who have provided ideas on Twitter about how we can be resilient in this difficult time; the top themes shared were about consideration for how our outdoor spaces can be used and for all to continue to spread love and kindness in different ways. I will take these suggestions into the planning process for when we are able to safely relax restrictions. Our efforts are working. We are seeing signs of hope, but we need to keep practicing physical distancing in order to get to the other side of the curve.  are updated on our website daily.  Lastly, I want to again thank the media for working diligently to keep residents informed about the COVID-19 situation in Ottawa.  The Province of Ontario is taking important steps to protect some of the most vulnerable residents in our community - the elderly and others with medical needs who live in long-term care facilities in Ontario. The safety of those most vulnerable to COVID-19 is of utmost importance. Hospitals in the region are in compliance with this new directive and are in the process of actioning the various recommendations. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic and response, Champlain Health Region Incident Command will be operationalizing the directive in the coming days and we will be addressing the nuances of this roll out. We are working together as a region to build capacity across the system for patients. Last week, we put processes in place to streamline transfers of COVID-19-positive patients requiring acute or critical care from smaller hospitals in the region to a select number of larger hospitals. This ensures that patients whose care needs cannot be met at their local hospitals will be moved to a higher-level care in a coordinated manner to balance capacity across our acute care centres. This process is running smoothly and has been used to facilitate several transfers. In addition, we are beginning to transfer patients with alternate level of care to regional hospitals to provide care in a setting that matches their needs. By applying this regional approach to patient flow, we’ll be able to ensure that we’re continuing to provide the best possible care for our most vulnerable patients. COVID-19 Care Clinics in the west and east ends continue to provide treatment for individuals who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms of respiratory illness requiring a medical assessment, such as coughs, fever, and other cold-like symptoms. The clinic in the west end is operated by the Queensway Carleton Hospital, while the clinic in the east end is operated by Hôpital Montfort – both with the help of community primary care physicians and pediatricians. To date the clinics have provided care for nearly 500 patients. I have an update on the COVID-19 Assessment Centre at Brewer Arena: the Assessment Centre has new operating hours, and will now be open from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. – seven days a week. Over the last month, the Assessment Centre has tracked patients arriving for care and the changes to the hours reflect that need for assessment. The care team has also been very successful in streamlining the process, allowing us to test more patients per hour than when we started. Today was another busy day at the Assessment Centre and we are grateful to the media for spreading the word on the new testing criteria.  This isn’t easy and we are not yet on the other side of the curve. We will keep communicating with the public to help people understand what is being asked of them. There is still a provincial order in place to limit gatherings to five people or less. The advice is still to stay home unless going out for essential reasons like groceries or prescriptions, to seek healthcare, help someone in need, or for daily physical activity.    We keep getting questions from residents and community groups about what physical distancing means. Can you talk with your neighbour over the fence or from a distance? Yes, if you are maintaining a two-metre distance between each other, and you are taking care to avoid people gathering in ways that could lead to more risk.  People are worried when they see others gathering in parking lots and driveways. Physical distancing is important because we know that some people may not have symptoms yet because they are in the early stages of infection. These individuals can spread the virus to others if physical distancing is not maintained. I want to acknowledge that this situation is difficult. These are stressful, uncertain and unprecedented times. We understand and recognize that many people are feeling isolated or lonely, even fearful. Many are anxious about the future, worried about falling behind in school, or wondering about how they’re going to pay the bills if their hours have been cut at work or they’ve been laid off from their jobs. The Ottawa Distress Centre is available for anyone who needs to talk to someone and to seek help. Of course, people want to connect with others during these difficult times. You want to be able to talk to your best friend, lean on your family, connect with your neighbours.   We’re asking that you use your best judgement and consider the safest options for doing so. Take advantage of technology for connecting with friends and family and try, as much as possible, to limit your in-person contacts to members of your household.   People are also asking about whether or not they should go outside for exercise. Physical activity and getting fresh air are important for our overall physical and mental wellbeing.  Unless you have been asked to self-isolate under the  , you can still go for a walk, run or ride your bike in your neighbourhood, on shared paths and through your local park.   Ottawa Public Health has also added new resources on staying active during this time, as well as a video on maintaining your mental health, to our  . For those needing financial support to get through this crisis, the COVID-19 page on the City of Ottawa   has a list of resources available from all levels of government.   I’d also like to address the approach to protecting people in long-term care and retirement homes. Ottawa Public Health shares the concerns expressed by the community and by other levels of government about the importance of protecting this vulnerable population.   All long-term care facilities and seniors’ residences operating in the City of Ottawa receive regular communications and guidance from OPH’s Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) team and are familiar with outbreak management protocols and COVID19-testing guidelines. For some time now, OPH has been instructing all retirement and long-term care homes with even one positive or presumptive case to take all the measures required to protect people in a respiratory outbreak situation. New provincial testing guidelines issued last week mean that we are now expanding COVID-19 testing in these homes to include asymptomatic residents and healthcare workers, whereas previous provincial direction was to only test people who were symptomatic. For all homes, the threshold for testing has been lowered, so that now residents will be tested even if they do not have a fever and a cough if there are other signs of a change in the person's health that could be related to a COVID19 infection. Everyone being admitted to a home will be tested, even if they do not have symptoms of infection.  Other supports to long-term care homes and retirement homes are being increased through partnership with other healthcare providers – like faster access to personal protective equipment and assistance with people who can do testing.  As of 4 pm yesterday, Ottawa Public Health is investigating 643 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the community and 16 ongoing outbreaks in institutions. That’s 24 new cases since yesterday. We now have 244 resolved cases.  There are currently 41 people in hospital and 18 of them are in ICU.  Sadly, 13 people have died. Of these individuals, 11 were over the age of 65 years and two were between 45-64 years old, seven males and six females.  Thank you again for all the actions you are taking as a community – these actions matter. By staying home you are keeping yourself, loved ones, and the community safer and supporting healthcare workers and other essential services providers to do their part to save lives. As a reminder, Ottawa Public Health is recommending that health care workers with any of the following symptoms be tested, regardless of exposure or travel history: Testing is necessary for health care workers even with mild respiratory symptoms, as they are on the frontlines in treating patients with COVID-19, and should be closely monitored. If you are sick, and wondering whether you should go to the Care Clinics, the COVID-19 Assessment Centre, or the Emergency Department, here is some information that might help. Assessment Centres in Eastern Ontario: As always, if you are in need of urgent medical attention, please go to your nearest Emergency Department, or call 9-1-1. We are ready and able to help anyone in need.   We have heard that people continue to seek clarity about what is  . Physical distancing involves taking steps to  . Overall this means limiting your contacts to members of your household as much as possible and avoiding all non-essential trips in the community. If you are in your driveway, on your front porch or out for a walk and want to connect with your neighbours, we encourage you to do this as long as you can maintain a 2 metre distance. These measures, along with proper hand hygiene and coughing and sneezing etiquette, are the best way to slow the spread of illness in our community. Sadly, 12 people have died. Of these individuals, 11 were over the age of 65 years and one was 45-64 years old, seven males and five females. The service was created for those who may find it impossible to reach out by calling a crisis line when trapped at home with their abuser due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and physical distancing measures. Thank you again for all the actions you are taking as a community – these actions matter. There would be more cases of COVID-19 in our community had everyone not done their part over the past month. During this holiday weekend, I hope you are finding ways to spend time with your household members and celebrate virtually with friends and family outside your household. The actions you are taking now will save lives and make a difference for your friends, family, neighbours and colleagues. Remember that COVID-19 affects everyone regardless of age and current health status. We often hear stories of older adults with COVID-19 as individuals older than 65 years old often experience the worst outcomes from COVID-19.  However, 79% of all confirmed cases in Ottawa are among people less than 65 years of age. It is important for all of us to do our part and prevent the spread.  Number of cases As of 4 pm yesterday, OPH is investigating 524 lab-confirmed cases in the community and 14 outbreaks in  . That’s 30 new cases since yesterday. We also have 170 resolved cases and two previously reported outbreaks are declared over. The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care changes daily. There are currently 37 people in hospital (four more than yesterday) and 13 of them are in ICU (no change since yesterday). Sadly, 11 people now have died. Of these individuals, 10 were over the age of 65 years and one was 45-64 years old, seven males and four females. Clarification about testing Our website has been updated with the  . We will continue to update the public with any new changes in testing recommendations that come from the Ontario Ministry of Health. Continuing to expand access to testing is important into the future to enable more targeted strategies and relaxation of physical distancing. If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has it, reminder for you to use the   to help determine how to seek further care. Clarification who needs to seek care and where to go We continue to hear that people want more clarity about where to get tested or access health care for COVID-19. Anyone with serious illness should never hesitate to go to Emergency Departments. The Ottawa-area hospitals all have capacity to provide emergency service to those who need it and they are using strict infection prevention and control measures. Thank you again for all the actions you are taking as a community – these actions matter.  There would be more cases of COVID-19 in our community had everyone not done their part over the past month.  Visit   for the latest news and updates.   With many religious holidays this weekend and in the coming weeks, this time may feel more difficult for many people. These holidays are often celebrated with gatherings of friends and family.    I urge everyone not to gather in person, even with extended family outside of your household, as we still need everyone’s efforts to flatten the curve. Instead, I encourage you to find ways to connect through technology for these celebrations.      We know following these measures has been difficult, and it’s understandable if you are feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Personal connections are how we often support one another through tough times, and this lack of in-person connection is one facet of what makes this emergency unique and more difficult. I encourage everyone to find ways to support their mental health at this time. Take the time to do what is best for you - whether that means taking a walk alone, taking a break from the news, or cooking a holiday meal with your household members.  Some people may consider using alcohol during times of stress. We also know that alcohol is the most commonly used substance in Ottawa. This was the case before this pandemic, and recent news reports during COVID-19 have indicated an increase in alcohol sales across the country. Alcohol use is associated with more negative outcomes for individuals and families.  There are some important things we can do to   during these challenging times: For all residents, there are resources and supports available for alcohol, substance use, and mental health, as well as for women and children specifically. Please visit our   to learn more and see what is available for you and your family. As of 4 pm yesterday, OPH is investigating 458 lab-confirmed cases in the community and 13 outbreaks in  . That’s 29 new cases since yesterday. We also have 143 resolved cases. The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care also changes daily. There are currently 30 people in hospital (five less than yesterday) and 12 of them are in ICU (one less than yesterday). Sadly, nine people now have died in total. Of these, 8 were over the age of 65 years and 1 was 45-64 years old. Six males and three females. There is now more capacity to test people at the COVID-19 Community Assessment Centre at Brewer Arena. The priority of the healthcare system is being able to test those who are most in need of testing. High priority individuals include: Testing is also available for the following people to be tested for COVID-19   such as fever, cough or shortness of breath: It is also important to remind everyone that it is still not recommended for asymptomatic people from the general public to be tested. To increase access to health services, a  opened this morning in Ottawa’s east end. It is operated by Hôpital Montfort, in partnership with Ottawa Public Health and the region’s Clinical Care Coordination Centre (C4). The clinic’s primary function is to provide treatment for people with symptoms of respiratory illness – cough, fever, and cold-like symptoms – that can’t be managed at home.   If you do need to access the Assessment Centre for testing or either care clinic over the long weekend, check out our webpage for  .     Thank you again for all the actions you are taking as a community – these actions matter. There would be more cases of COVID-19 in our community had everyone not done their part over the past month.  Visit   for the latest news and updates.   The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care also changes daily. There are currently 36 people in hospital (up from 30 yesterday) and 14 of them are in ICU (no change from yesterday). No new deaths have been reported as of 4 pm yesterday. As a reminder, we have added detailed information on our OPH website regarding cases. If you have specific questions about case counts, number of people hospitalized and other demographic information please go to  . If you look at the epidemiological curve of Ottawa residents with confirmed COVID-19, you’ll note that the number of daily cases is slowing down. While this is hopeful, it would be premature to conclude that the curve is flattening and that COVID-19 is circulating less in our community. Testing people for COVID-19 is an important strategy to confirm how many cases are in our community.  In conversation with our health system partners, we know that the Brewer Arena Assessment Centre has capacity to test more people and we are encouraging people to make use of this service.   Currently the highest priority for testing, includes: We also strongly encourage the following people to also be tested for COVID-19: There is now a   directly from the provincial laboratory system. This portal was launched on Sunday by the Government of Ontario and offers fast and secure access to test results on your computer and mobile device. Yesterday, Dr. Theresa Tam announced that the Special Advisory Committee on COVID-19 has come to a consensus that wearing a non-medical mask, even with no symptoms, is a measure you can take to protect those around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain such as when using public transit or at the grocery store. In addition to the importance of testing and the use of non-medical masks, my message today is clear: It is critical that we continue to practice physical distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Ottawa. We know that COVID-19 is a heavy virus spread through droplets. A non-medical mask can reduce the chance of your respiratory droplets coming into contact with others or landing on surfaces. I want to emphasize that wearing a non-medical mask in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it – it is an additional way to protect others around you. We have updated a section on our website devoted specifically to frequently asked questions about masks. Please visit   for more information. With many religious holidays coming up such as Easter, Passover and Ramadan this may feel like an even harder time for many to practice physical distancing. These holidays are often spent gathering with family and friends. Residents must continue to find ways to connect using technology during these celebrations. I urge you not to gather in person, even with extended family outside your household, as we still need everyone’s efforts to flatten the curve. As we enter spring, we have had some beautiful weather and the days will continue to get warmer. I continue to encourage residents who are not ill to go outside and get some fresh air. You can spend time in your yard or walking around your neighbourhood. Go for a walk, run or bike ride through your neighbourood park. But you must ensure you are practicing physical distancing at all times and that you are limiting your contacts to household members.  You must not rest or play on structures or gather with others in parks as this could increase your exposure to the virus. Visit   for more information and guidance. Finally, please   for my message to residents about how we can continue to practice physical distancing. We’re all going through this together and we will see the other side of the curve. T As part of the ongoing efforts to provide important health care services to Ottawa residents during the COVID-19 pandemic, the  The Care Clinic is a partnership with Queensway Carleton Hospital, Ottawa Public Health As of 4 pm yesterday, OPH is investigating 370 lab-confirmed cases in the community and seven outbreaks in institutions. That’s 48 new cases since our last report on Saturday. We also have 56 resolved cases. The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care also changes daily. There are currently 30 people in hospital and 14 of them are in ICU. Sadly, six people now have died in total. Of these, five were over the age of 65 years and one was 45-64 years old. Three males and three females. As a reminder, we have added some of this detailed information on our website if you have specific questions about case counts, number of people hospitalized and other demographic information please go to  . I know that residents and media are interested in local modelling data.  I was happy to have Dr. Manuel from the Ottawa Hospital join the media availability last week. We are working with him and his team to make further data available to the public later this week.  until the end of June was not taken lightly. This is a crucial time in our efforts to plank the curve. Now more than ever, it’s important for residents to stay home except for essential trips out of the home and to practice physical distancing at all times when they do venture out. These actions make a difference. There would be more COVID-19 infections in our community now if residents were not doing their part.  Together, we are making sure hospitals are able to provide life-saving care. We recognize that this is not easy. The days can feel quite long when staying home. You may be feeling lonely or anxious. I encourage you to find ways to continue to connect with your friends, extended family or neighbours through technology. The Distress Centre of Ottawa is also available to provide support. If you need someone to talk to, you can call 613-238-3311 24/7 to connect with someone. We also recognize that for many in our community, financial pressures are making this situation much more difficult. All levels of government are taking steps to help in this regard. Please visit Ottawa.ca for information on these measures and for a list of resources. Finally, I wanted to share that the COVID-19 Care Clinic opened today in Ottawa’s West end, under the leadership of the Queensway Carleton Hospital and the Champlain Health Region Incident Command. The clinic involves the City of Ottawa, CHEO, primary care physicians, community pediatricians and the regional COVID-19 planning team.  It is equipped to do basic diagnostic tests, such as chest X-rays and lab tests. It is located at 595 Moodie Drive and will be operating Monday to Friday from 9 am to 4 pm. Residents should go to the COVID-19 care clinics if they have escalating symptoms of respiratory illness, including a fever or worsening cough and flu-like symptoms, and they are in need of medical attention. Residents do not need to be tested before going to the care clinic. The care clinic will help people get the treatment they require for respiratory illness, while helping keep emergency departments for emergencies. I want to thank everyone for doing their part to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This is easier when we recognize we are all in it together. We all make a difference, when we all practice physical distancing.  Thank you to everyone that is doing the right thing – staying home and keeping your physical distance. We can change the impact that this pandemic has on our city when we all work together.  Yesterday, the province shared projections of total numbers of cases and deaths in Ontario in different scenarios. It is important to note that the different curves and projections show that the measures we are currently taking (e.g. closures of schools and public spaces and ensuring everyone keeps their distance), do make a difference in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and can prevent deaths. The actions of every individual determine which curve we will experience – and we are aiming for the lowest curve possible. The least number of infections at once will ensure that the healthcare system can continue to handle the demand. We are working with our partners to determine what these provincial projections may mean for our city.  We understand many people may be frustrated with the length of time to receive test results. There is now a   directly from the provincial laboratory system. This portal was launched yesterday by the Government of Ontario and offers fast and secure access to test results on your computer and mobile device.   As of 4 pm yesterday, OPH is investigating 322 lab-confirmed cases in Ottawa in the community and six outbreaks in institutions. That’s 33 new cases since our last report.  Sadly, we are sharing the news of the fourth COVID-related death in Ottawa.  This death is not related to an outbreak in an institution. To respect the person and their family’s privacy we will not be providing greater details on this case.   The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care changes daily. There are currently 26 people in hospital – one more than yesterday, and 12 of them are in ICU, which is two more than yesterday. We have had an increase of one facility experiencing an outbreak since yesterday’s report. The additional institutional outbreak reported in our   is at The Ottawa Hospital. It is important to note that there is only one confirmed case in this outbreak. As in all outbreaks, Ottawa Public Health will follow up with any close contacts of individuals with confirmed COVID-19. Ottawa Public Health and The Ottawa Hospital are working closely together to implement measures to reduce the severity and length of the outbreak. Thank you again for your cooperation as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. I am inspired by the supports that so many Ottawans are providing to each other, whether checking in virtually or helping with grocery runs. While we usually want to visit in-person, to share and manage in times of stress, keeping our contacts to household members as much as possible is going to get us through this pandemic. Please continue to visit   for the latest information. As the weather gets warmer, some people may be considering moving to seasonal cottages to isolate themselves there.  We want to discourage this and are encouraging our residents to stay at home. This will ensure that residents have the necessary social and health supports in place if you become ill with COVID-19. Health care systems in smaller and remote communities typically have less capacity to provide health care services with the increased demands of COVID-19 and risk being overwhelmed if needing to care for non-permanent residents.    I totally understand concerns that families have about their loved ones who reside in retirement or long-term care homes. Some families are considering whether to take loved ones out of their retirement or long-term care home. This is a challenging decision and I can share some issues that families need to consider. Putting COVID-19 aside for a moment, a family would need to think about the individual’s health, particularly why they decided to live in the retirement or long-term care home in the first place, and the extent of which their condition has changed over time. Will the family be able to assure the safety and care their loved one requires? COVID-19 presents additional challenges. If the resident is coming from a home with an outbreak, then need to assume that they may be infected and act accordingly with precautions in the home for 14 days so other household members would not become infected. There is the additional risk over time that other members of the household, who perhaps could have asymptomatic infections acquired outside the home, to expose their family member. And lastly, that the former resident would not be able to return to the home if there was an outbreak at their facility. As I indicated, not a simple decision for families to make.  I'm sure you've all heard Ontario's projections for COVID-19 cases and death earlier today. I'd like to reiterate that we need everyone to stay home and practice physical distancing. The public health measures we have implemented in Ottawa and across Ontario are critical to make the difference we are seeking from the projected worst-case scenario.  So, I want to repeat what the province has said: Stay home. Stop the spread.And stay safe.  As of 4 pm yesterday, OPH is investigating 289 lab-confirmed cases in Ottawa in the community and five outbreaks in institutions. That’s 37 new cases since our last report. Again, the majority of this increase is due to the backlog of tests with specimens collected on or before March 22.   The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care also changes daily. There are currently 25 people in hospital – one more than yesterday, and 10 of them are in ICU, which is three more than yesterday. We have had no increase in the number of facilities experiencing an outbreak since yesterday’s report. This includes three retirement homes, one long-term care home, and one group home.  Thank you again for your ongoing cooperation in keeping residents informed and reducing the spread of COVID-19. We have seen the projections released by the Ontario Government this afternoon, and we are reviewing them to ensure our regional preparation activities are aligned. I’m able to share with you today an initiative between all hospitals in the Champlain region to optimize the movement of patients through the healthcare sector—this is known as patient flow. Our hospitals have a long history of collaborating to ensure that the safety of patients and staff is at the forefront of everything that we do. As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve locally, we have developed a regional patient flow strategy that will allow patients to be cared for in the most appropriate centre given their unique care needs. Patient flow across the region will be coordinated by a single command centre. Hospitals will transfer COVID-19 positive patients who need acute or critical care to a select number of designated hospitals that have units for COVID-19 positive patients. Patients who do not require this level of care will be transferred out of acute and critical care hospitals to the most appropriate hospital setting.  Our goal is to optimize the entire healthcare system in the region. This will ensure that we are ready for a surge of patients requiring care for COVID-19, while ensuring we continue to provide services to the many patients requiring care unrelated to the pandemic. Evaluating patient flow from a regional lens will enable hospitals to maintain access to patient care, and ensure that no single area of the health system becomes overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is critical as everything interconnected, and we have to support our partners. As I mentioned yesterday, the first COVID-19 Care Clinic—led by the Queensway Carleton Hospital and supported by regional partners—will be opening on Monday, April 6.   We are ready to open a second Care Clinic, which will be located in the East End —led by Hôpital Montfort— and this will based on the volume of patients we observe. The second Care Clinic can be operational at any time if activated by Ontario Health. This will serve to further protect our Emergency Departments, and will also reduce pressure on our family doctor’s offices.  If you’re waiting at home for your results after being tested for COVID-19 and begin to experience shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest Emergency Department or call 911. Otherwise, please continue to self-isolate while you await your results. Please go to your nearest Emergency Department for all non-COVID-19 related medical emergencies. We are ready and able to help anyone in need. Hi I'm Dr. Doug Manuel. I am a Senior Scientist at the Ottawa Hospital and a Distinguished Professor at the University of Ottawa. I am a research scientist, a public health specialist and family doctor. I've been asked by the Hospital and Ottawa Public Health to assist with COVID-19 modelling and projections. We just heard a few hours ago about projections from Ontario Public Health. I am helping with local insights to those numbers. We have good local data that can help us augment those provincial projections. For me, projecting COVID-19 is like forecasting a hurricane. We need to constantly update our projections with the latest data, including local data to help understand when and where the hurricane will reach landfall. That is what we will be doing in the coming weeks. While it’s hard to forecast long-term, we are able forecast more effectively for a shorter range — and that will give us time to plan as a region if needed.   There is one really big difference between projecting hurricanes and projecting COVID-19. We can't prevent a hurricane from reaching the shore. Ontario’s projections today told us that we can prevent many, if not most of the health effects of COVID-19, including deaths. The actions of individuals in our community make the difference – if we work together, we can change the direction of this pandemic. Thank you.  I am joining you today to speak about how our officers are serving our community during the COVID-19 pandemic. As you are all aware, our service is now responsible for the enforcement of the rules set out under the Ontario Emergency Management and Civil Protections Act relating to gatherings of more than five people, restaurants offering dine-in options to customers, businesses open without an exemption and gatherings in City parks, including the use of play structures. Yesterday our officers received 130 calls in regards to Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act issues and closed parks. We had complaints about a farm allowing horseback riding lessons, hair salons continuing to operate, groups playing soccer at Millennium Park in Orleans, beach volleyball at Britannia Beach … neighbours gathering in each others back yards. We have heard concerns from residents not sure when they should be contacting 3-1-1: Let me be clear. If you see residents playing on a soccer field, or on a play structure in a park … regardless of whether it is on City or Private property, you can report this to 3-1-1. If you see a restaurant offering dine-in services to customers, or a non-essential business that is operating …. Call 3-1-1. We have a dedicated team of Officers who are not only responding to these calls but are proactively visiting parks across the City. Our goal right now is to educate the public … to let them know these rules are in place for their safety… We have issued dozens of verbal warnings at this point … but please know that failure to comply with our verbal warnings can result in fines under the provincial Act of up to $100,000 for individuals, $500,000 for a director of a corporation or $10-million for a corporation itself. I would like to remind the public that these orders have been put in place for public safety and to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. I thank each and every resident who has been adhering to these new regulations. We know physical distancing is not easy, but by following these rules we will make a difference and we will get through this together. We want to ensure that all residents have important information about measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, regardless of whether they can access our webpage or social media channels. Therefore, every household in Ottawa will soon receive a handout in the mail with detailed information about physical distancing.  A reminder that when receiving a package, newspaper, or mail, to always wash your hands well with soap and water after handling it.  If you have questions about mail and parcels and risk of COVID-19, check out our   on this topic. It is imperative that all residents continue to practice physical distancing and keep contacts limited to those within your household as much as possible.  More people are being asked to self-isolate: people with confirmed COVID-19 and their close contacts, adults older than 70 years of age, people with respiratory symptoms, and anyone returning from travel.  When self-isolating, it is important to stay in a separate room from other people in your home as much as possible and when you are in the same room to keep a distance of at least two metres and wear a mask.  Additional guidance for self-isolation and also for household members is available on our website.        As of 4 pm yesterday, OPH is investigating 252 lab-confirmed cases in Ottawa in the community and five outbreaks in institutions. That’s 58 new cases since our last report.  Again, this increase is mainly due to the backlog of tests with specimens collected on or before Mar 20, and not a spike of recent cases. The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care also changes daily. There are currently 24 people in hospital – one less than yesterday, and seven of them are in ICU, which is the same as yesterday. We have had no increase in the number of facilities experiencing an outbreak since yesterday’s report. This includes: three retirement homes, one long-term care home, and one group home. There continues to be discussion about who should wear a mask and the effectiveness of masks.  At this time, we are advising that anyone who is sick or is caring for someone who is sick to wear a mask.  It is very important that people with symptoms wear a mask, especially when going to an appointment, clinic or a hospital. Overall, we need to make sure our healthcare workers who are on the frontlines of caring for people have first priority for medical masks. For people who are healthy and not coughing and sneezing, you are not required to wear a mask. I would first stress the importance of hand washing and physical distancing – these are known strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  While homemade masks alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19, I would not discourage people in the community who want to wear a homemade mask. Yesterday, Dr. Tam and Minister Hadju also provided updated guidance on the use of homemade masks.  A homemade facemask may prevent you from touching your nose and mouth and may help cover a cough or sneeze to keep it to yourself.  To improve effectiveness: We do have guidance on our website how to put a mask on properly if you need or decide to wear one. Thank you again for your ongoing patience and cooperation in keeping residents informed. Please continue to visit: OttawaPublicHealth.ca/Coronavirus     I want to thank everyone for joining us today as we update you on the COVID-19 situation in Ottawa. I’d like to start by announcing today that we will be hosting a virtual town hall on the topic of COVID-19 in Ottawa. This virtual town hall will take place on Thursday, April 9 at 2 pm. This will be an opportunity for residents with to call-in and ask questions about COVID-19 to myself and other City leaders. Like we did with the last City Council meeting, residents can also watch the virtual town hall on Rogers Television. I encourage you to watch for details on the City’s social media channels, as well as in an ad in this weekend’s Ottawa Citizen and Le Droit. As many of you aware, one of our OC Transpo operators has tested positive for COVID-19. This individual has been in self isolation since developing symptoms on March 20, and remains in self isolation at home after receiving the positive test result on March 21. I want to assure you all that OC Transpo has put several measures in place to protect both customers and bus operators. OC Transpo is working with Ottawa Public Health to trace and contact individuals who have, or may have been, in close contact with this operator, this would include staff, friends and family. OC Transpo has identified and removed the vehicles that were driven by the operator from service. These vehicles will undergo a deep clean and full sanitation before entering back into service. OC Transpo customers who have concerns about this exposure can call OPH at 613-580-6744 to speak to a public health nurse, or they can visit Ottawa-public-health-dot-c-a. Our best wishes are with the operator as they recover from this virus. As you know, many residents and businesses are being financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic – either through layoffs, closures or reduced business. We have developed some property tax relief for those residents and businesses with a 2020 Property Tax Hardship Plan, which was approved by City Council last week. If you are approved, the payment for both the interim and final property taxes will be due on October 30. I want to remind you that in order to qualify for approval, you must complete an online application that is available on ottawa.ca/taxrelief. It’s important to go online now and complete the application, as the grace period for all property owners to pay the interim property tax bill ends on April 15. I want to also remind impacted landlords that many of your tenants are in the same financial boat as you are. Property owners with tenants who do not pass on the deferral are deemed ineligible for the hardship deferral program and all taxes, penalty and interest are payable immediately. We will all get through this better if we continue to work together as a community. I also want to remind residents that is it critical that we listen to our medical experts here at OPH, as well as our federal and provincial experts, and practice physical distancing. If we want to flatten the curve and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our community, this is of utmost importance. I have heard some concerning reports of larger groups of residents gathering together – in both public and private settings. For example, Bylaw and Regulatory Services had to respond to a child’s birthday party held in a backyard, which had between 12 and 20 children present. Bylaw officer had to visit Lansdowne Park on a complaint that more than 20 people were playing on the play structures and in the skate park. Bylaw also received complaints about a yard sale in the Greenboro area. It’s unfortunate, but we just can’t have these types of gatherings. I know we want to continue some sort of normalcy in our lives. We want to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries and special occasions. We want to spend time with our family and our friends. But, please, limit your gatherings to the members of your immediate family who live in your residence. I want to take this opportunity to thank our City Bylaw officers who have been busy responding to calls reporting large social gatherings. Bylaw and Regulatory Services received 139 calls for Provincial Orders and closed parks – and this was just yesterday. So, please, stay home and respect the physical distancing guidelines. This is our collective responsibility. We need everyone to work together to help protect all our residents. Speaking of lending a helping hand, I also want to remind residents that the City has launched a formal donation process for businesses and residents to donate commercial-grade personal protective equipment to protect our emergency responders and front-line workers who are supporting the COVID-19 pandemic response. The PPE supplies must be commercial-grade and in their original packaging. I want to thank all the residents and businesses who have generously come forward to donate through this formal process. For those still interested in donating, you are asked to email donations@ottawa.ca, and provide information on the items and quantities.  Again, I want to thank all our residents for their generosity and for their collaboration as we continue to fight COVID-19. Responding to this crisis must be a joint effort . OPH and the City can message all kinds of useful information but if the general public does not follow the directions given then we have a problem and that problem is not going to go away. An excellent and telling example of that is the growing number of incidents of people gathering in public places like parks. Most people are following the rules and those efforts are greatly appreciated but many are not . I tweeted out a photo on this issue yesterday and it has been looked at by more than 1600 people. It has been liked and shared . There were no negative online comments and yet all through the day I received email concerns about people gathering in a variety of different parks and using play structures. Bylaw has been alerted and they will do what they can. However one has to ask if this is really the best use of City resources at this point in time . People have suggested to me that we  put fences up in the parks or remove swings and slides . Again the question is whether this is really the best use of City resources . In both cases the answer is a resounding no. We all know or should know and the City and OPH will continue to pump out the message that we should not be gathering in the parks or other public spots. The Provincial and Federal governments continue  send the same message and we thank them for that. Do the right thing, not necessarily the easy thing with kids to entertain and the weather warming up, but the right thing and stay out of the parks. Secondly, and just as importantly please recognize that this fight is not over and will not likely be over any  time soon. The restrictions will continue for the foreseeable future whether it be school closures or the rules relating to how  businesses can currently operate . We must accordingly continue in a response mode to this crisis. I fully believe we can be successful in our efforts if we work as a collective and respect the greater communal goals. We must stay the course by staying apart. Thank you. As we start a new month, we recognize that our new norms of physical distancing, school closures, and changes to employment settings and situations will remain in place this month.  Please be sure to check out the resources available from Ottawa Public Health, provincial and federal government, and other partners to support you during this time.  There are many resources to: support your physical and mental health; supplement finances; provide childcare for essential workers; help student learn at home; and much more.  Despite the situation continually changing each day, a few things continue to remain the same. Our goal remains the same – we want to flatten the curve and stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community.  And at this time, our guidance remains the same: stay home and only go out for the essentials.  If you have returned from travel or have respiratory symptoms, you must self-isolate.  We want to reiterate a statement from Dr. Theresa Tam yesterday, that COVID-19 does not discriminate.  All residents are susceptible to COVID-19.  Young people are getting it and are being hospitalized in Ottawa.  People of all ages need to stay home, limit contact to those people in your own household as much as possible, and only go out for essential work or supplies.  OPH makes taking care of our employees a top priority, so we can take care of the public. We have a policy for “forced rest” for people to take breaks on a regular basis.   This will ensure sustainability of response during this pandemic.  Number of cases As of 4 pm yesterday, OPH is investigating 194 confirmed cases in Ottawa and five outbreaks – in three retirement homes and one long-term care home that we shared yesterday, plus a new outbreak with 1 confirmed case at a group home - Ottawa-Carleton Association for Persons with Developmental Disabilities. That’s 50 new cases since our last report.  This increase in cases is in large part due to the processing of the “backlog” of tests with the majority of specimens taken on or before March 19. The epidemic curve on our website provides the picture of the increase over time. The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care also changes daily. There are currently 25 people in hospital – 5 more than yesterday, 7 of them are in ICU, which is 1 more than yesterday.  Looking at the overall data for the outbreak, seniors aged 65 years and older were the most frequent age group ever hospitalized (49%) or ever in the ICU (67%).  So this means, the majority of hospitalizations (51%) and 33% of ICU admissions are people under 65 years of age.   Case and contact management On the topic of case and contact management, we continue to receive guidance from the provincial Ministry of Health.  Currently OPH case managers are in touch with all positive cases and close contacts and provide education on self-isolation requirements.  Based on the latest guidance, we are strengthening case and contact measures to ensure that individuals with COVID-19 and their close contacts remain on strict self-isolation. These efforts will help us flatten the curve and stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community in addition to the social distancing measures currently being encouraged. I want to reiterate to the public that Emergency Departments in the city are still here to care for you. Please continue to go to the nearest emergency department for any medical emergency. We are ready and able to help anyone in need.  If you’re waiting at home for your results after being tested for COVID-19 and begin to experience shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest Emergency Department or call 911. Otherwise, please continue to self-isolate while you await your results.   I want to take a moment to thank all of the people and organizations who have donated personal protective equipment to health-care organizations throughout the region. Just to name a few: Hydro Ottawa and Tomlinson Group made significant donations over the last couple of days.  We would like to thank our researchers at The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute for their continued efforts in raising PPE for the region.  The University of Ottawa has also gathered substantial donations in PPE both from researchers and students across faculties, as well as from the community.   If you would like to donate PPE, please send an email to   – which is where the community can send their offers. Gowns, masks, gloves, face shields, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are all welcome. It is important to note that this is a regional supply and donations will be distributed to health-care organizations throughout the Champlain Region.   The Clinical Care Coordination Committee – C4- continues to plan and activate the regional response to COVID-19 with our partners in Eastern Ontario. I can update you on some of the C4 planning that is now being rolled out, in partnership with the Almonte General Hospital and Winchester District memorial hospitals. The Almonte Assessment Centre opens today. It is by referral by the family physician and an appointment is required. In addition, the Winchester Assessment Centre opens tomorrow. A reminder that the Hawkesbury Assessment Centre is also up and running through a partnership with The Eastern Ontario Health Unit and the Hawkesbury and District General Hospital. The Ottawa Assessment Centre at Brewer Arena continues to serve its purpose of relieving some of the pressure off local Emergency Departments, so that they can provide care to those who are acutely ill. So far, 5,500 people have been assessed at the Centre – and about 85% have been swabbed. I can tell you that there are ongoing efforts to increase the PROVINCIAL lab testing capacity. As of Sunday, the provincial lab increased its capacity by over 150% to approximately 4,800 tests per day. This has reduced the PROVINCIAL backlog by one THIRD since March 25. This is good news for those patients in our region, who are awaiting their results from the centralized lab. In the meantime, the REGIONAL lab has about a 48-hour turnaround time, so we are getting closer to the type of patient experience we want for the residents of Eastern Ontario. If you’re waiting at home for your results after being tested for COVID-19, and begin to experience shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest Emergency Department or call 911.   Please continue to go to the nearest emergency department for any non-COVID related medical emergencies. We are ready and able to help anyone in need. Donations of PPE continue to come in throughout the region. In response to the donation offers, we created  ,which is where the community can send their offers. Gowns, masks, gloves, face shields, disinfectant wipes, and hand sanitizer are all welcome. It is important to note that this is a regional supply.  The situation around COVID-19 continues to evolve quickly, and our team has been working around the clock to review new directives and guidelines coming from upper levels of government, assess the local situation and provide our community with the best possible advice. As we mentioned yesterday, we are changing how we report case data on our website. Going forward, our website will have more information on case data and will align with provincial reporting. Please watch for this in the coming days. Given the rapid changes, we continue to encourage residents to visit our website at   for the latest information. This morning, we were informed that the Ministry of Education has decided that Ontario schools will remain closed until at least May. We recognize that this situation is difficult for families. It’s difficult for children who want to be in school, learning, and interacting with their friends, teachers, and other school supports. It’s also difficult for parents as many continue to work either from home or in the community at essential businesses or services. However, continued physical (social) distancing is crucial to flattening the curve. Number of cases As of 4 pm yesterday, OPH is investigating 144 confirmed cases in Ottawa. That’s 14 new reported cases since we reported to you yesterday. Sadly, we have also had our third COVID-related death in Ottawa. The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care also changes daily. There are currently 20 people in hospital – three more than yesterday, six of them are in ICU, which is one less than yesterday. We also now have one additional resolved case for a total of 11. Long-term care and retirement homes As a result of new direction from the Ministry of Health with respect to long-term care and retirement homes, the COVID-19 outbreak definition has changed whereby we are to now consider a single laboratory confirmed case of COVID-19, in a resident or staff member, as a confirmed respiratory outbreak in the home. As a result, additional homes have now moved out of “outbreak watch” to status as having a confirmed COVID-19 outbreak. This does not change OPH’s response, since outbreak precautions were already put in place, however, it does change reporting of the number of confirmed outbreaks in these institutions. As such, OPH now has four confirmed outbreaks - three in retirement homes and one in a long-term care home. In addition to Orleans Promenade and Maplewood, which were previously reported, we have now added Park Place and Garden Terrace as facilities with confirmed outbreaks. The confirmed facilities are as follows: Orleans Promenade– three residents, including two deaths Maplewood Retirement Community – one resident and one health care worker Park Place – one health care worker Garden Terrace – one health care worker The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and every resident must continue doing their part to keep themselves, their family members, their neighbours, co-workers and community members healthy and safe, and reduce the spread of this virus. Thank you again for your ongoing patience and cooperation in keeping residents informed. Please continue to visit   for the latest information. Before I begin, I would like to offer my most sincere condolences to the family of the resident who has passed away this past weekend. As Dr. Etches mentioned, this is the second death related to COVID-19, it serves as a sad and important reminder that we all need to do our part in making efforts to flatten the curve. This means washing your hands regularly, respecting physical (social) distancing guidelines, limiting trips outside the house to essential ones only, and to check in virtually on family, friends and neighbours. We need to keep residents safe and do everything we can to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. That is why Ottawa By-law Officers have been given the ability to enforce new rules under the Ontario   related to physical distancing. This means that, effective immediately, a dedicated team of officers at By-law and Regulatory Services will be proactively monitoring and enforcing calls related to: Residents who witness these issues should report them by calling 3-1-1. By-law Officers will be taking a progressive enforcement approach; with the initial goal to educate residents and businesses about these laws and their importance to public health. As time goes on, failure to comply could result in fines under the provincial  of up to $100,000 for individuals, $500,000 for a director of a corporation or $10-million for a corporation itself. By-law and Regulatory Services continues to collaborate with the Ottawa Police Service, which will continue to enforce calls related to Quarantine Orders issued to individuals who have been travelling or are experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19. Complaints related to the Quarantine Act should be reported to the non-urgent Ottawa Police phone line at 613-236-1222.   In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now facing the 2020 Spring Freshet. Many of Ottawa residents awoke today with renewed concerns for potential flooding given the heavy weekend rains. Staff has advised me that water levels are not currently at threatening levels. Later today, I will be issuing a memo to Council saying that I have asked Councillor Eli El-Chantiry to play a leadership role as Council Liaison on the 2020 Spring Freshet. Councillor El-Chantiry has been front and centre in helping our local communities rebuild after the devastating floods that hit our City in 2017 and 2019. Some of you may recall that Councillor El-Chantiry was helping his friends and neighbours sandbag their properties while his family was losing a property to the flooding. Councillor El-Chantiry will work closely with members of Councillor whose wards have been most severely impacted in the past, including Councillor Theresa Kavanagh (Bay) and Councillor George Darouze (Osgoode) - who is temporarily managing Cumberland Ward issues for Cumberland Village and other parts of the ward. I want to thank Councillor El-Chantiry for liaising with the City’s senior leadership team, my office, members of Council and key community agencies over the course of the coming days and until such time as the 2020 spring flood threat is behind us. This is an exceptionally challenging time for our City and our residents, and I want to thank Councillor El-Chantiry and all members of Council for working together as we focus on mobilizing the spirit and resources our communities need to overcome these challenges. I appreciate the opportunity to address the public during these very trying times and I thank the media for assisting OPH in getting important messages delivered . I want to take this opportunity to recognize all the hard work that OPH staff and all healthcare providers are putting in as our first line of Defense against COVID-19. The challenge is a significant one but there are simple things we can all do to assist in the fight. First and foremost stay informed so you can stay on top of your personal health situation. The best way to do this is to check the OPH website regularly.  Secondly, practice physical distancing. This means no unnecessary trips out of the home and no public gatherings. Thirdly, during these difficult times treat your friends and neighbours with kindness and compassion. Reach out virtually to check up on one another . Look after one another . Let’s stick together by staying apart. Thank you. As of this morning, there are 130 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ottawa. That’s eight new reported cases since yesterday. You may have noticed that the Ministry of Health has changed the way it is reporting case data. We also understand that going forward, the Ministry of Health is going to provide more information on cases across Ontario at 10:30 daily, based on results available as of 4 pm the day before. As the number of cases grows, the Ottawa Public Health (OPH) team is adjusting how we collect and track data and we are also working to update our reporting strategy to align with Ministry reporting. We now have outbreaks in two retirement homes in Ottawa. There are currently five confirmed cases at Orleans Promenade and counts pending for another outbreak at Maplewood Retirement Community. Sadly, we have also had our second COVID-related death in Ottawa. The second death is a resident from Orleans Promenade.  OPH continues to investigate and support both homes with their outbreak management measures. We are connecting with close contacts, as we do in all cases.   The number of people hospitalized has increased. There are now 21 people in hospital, six of them are in ICU.  Fortunately, we can now report 10 resolved cases.   Yesterday the provincial government announced new restrictions on group gatherings which are now limited to a maximum of five people, with exceptions for:  Earlier today, Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams, issued a statement calling on Ontarians to do more to combat the spread of COVID-19, noting that opting out is NOT an option.  He strongly recommended that all residents stay home except for essential reasons, such as to:  Given the greater risk of severe outcomes to Ontarians who are elderly, he also strongly recommended that individuals over 70 years of age self-isolate.   This also applies to individuals who have compromised immune systems and/or underlying medical conditions.  We recognize that physical (social) distancing and self-isolation is hard. People may be feeling disconnected and experience difficulties in managing stress or anxiety. We also know that for some, home is not a safe place. We were pleased to see yesterday’s announcements by the federal government for funding for Kids Help Phone and New Horizons for Seniors through United Way. If you are struggling, please reach out. Our website has a list of   available in our community. The Ottawa Distress Centre is also available for people needing more support.  I also want to reinforce that anyone who is not experiencing signs of illness and who is not subject to   should try to get outside for fresh air and exercise in order to maintain their health during these difficult times. When doing so, please remember to practice physical (social) distancing. That means staying about two meters away from anyone you encounter during your walk.  Passing someone on a sidewalk is not considered a high-risk activity for infection with COVID-19.  Thank you again for your ongoing patience and cooperation in keeping residents informed. Please continue to visit: OttawaPublicHealth.ca/Coronavirus        If you’re waiting at home for your results after being tested for COVID-19 and begin to experience shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest Emergency Department or call 911.  And please continue to go to the nearest emergency department for any non-COVID related medical emergencies. We are ready and able to help anyone in need. Nos services d’urgence sont prêts à vous accueillir s’il vous faut des soins urgents. La mise en place du Centre d’évaluation pour la COVID-19 a permis de soulager la pression sur les Urgences. Alors si vous avez besoin de soins médicaux urgents, n’hésitez pas à aller à la salle d’Urgence la plus proche.  Si vous attendez vos résultats de dépistage de la COVID-19 et que vos symptômes s’aggravent (p. ex. essoufflement, douleur à la poitrine), allez à l’Urgence la plus proche ou appelez le 911. We are aware that there is a backlog in processing tests in Ontario. All swab analysis was sent to a centralized lab for processing prior to March 23. A dedicated team is working to get those results back from the central lab for residents of Eastern Ontario.  Last week, The Eastern Ontario Regional Lab Association (EORLA), began COVID-19 testing locally and has made significant progress to increase our regional test capacity. I want to thank everyone still waiting, for their patience. In the meantime, please do not seek retesting or call the centralized Public Health Lab in Toronto for results, as they are unable to release results to individuals. Patients who were seen at the Assessment Centre at Brewer arena, will be contacted by telephone by clinical staff from The Ottawa Hospital or CHEO. Our community has stepped forward, like many others across the province.  We are receiving donations of supplies from people in health care, education, technology and the construction industry.  We are grateful for the community support. In response to the donation offers, we created COVIDDonations@toh.ca – which is where the community can send their offers. Gowns, masks, gloves, face shields, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are all welcome. It is important to note that this is a regional supply. I can also provide an update on the care clinics in the community. These care clinics will be ready to open quickly when needed to support our health-care system. This is a collaboration between Queensway Carleton Hospital and Hopital Montfort, supported by our regional partners. These care clinics are specifically designed to absorb an increased volume of patients with febrile respiratory illness, offloading local emergency departments and family doctors' offices. They will be able to provide diagnostics as well as care, and we hope to deflect these patients from emergency departments while at the same time providing a high standard of care. Finally, at the request from the province, and along with other Ontario hospitals, we are now reporting our PPE inventory to the province.   It’s a challenging and even frustrating time for everyone – parents, children, teenagers, seniors, employers and employees and essential services workers. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and every citizen must continue doing their part to keep themselves, their family members, their neighbours, co-workers and community members healthy and safe, and reduce the spread of this virus. As of this morning, there are 122 confirmed cases in Ottawa and a second outbreak at a retirement home in Ottawa, at Maplewood Retirement Community. OPH continues to investigate the outbreak. The retirement home has implemented outbreak management and OPH is connecting with close contacts, as we do in all cases. All residents have been notified and are in self-isolation. Staff at the retirement home continue to be screened and have been instructed to wear personal protective equipment in the building, specifically wearing a mask when entering the building and following droplet/contact procedures in all resident rooms. With more cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Ottawa, including confirmation of community spread, we continue to urge everyone to practice physical (social) distancing or self-isolate if you develop symptoms.  Some key things to remember: For individuals with respiratory symptoms (such as fever, cough), please follow these directives: For individuals who are returning from travel, by federal law, you must immediately self-isolate for 14 days.   For ALL Ottawa residents (except those listed above) And some special reminders for parents with children, as well as all of us as we practice physical (social) distancing:   You can go outside.  It’s healthy. You can still take a walk, play with your dog outside, or kick a ball with members of your household who are already close contacts. When outside, maintain a two-metre distance. Avoid crowds and maintain a distance of two metres (six feet) from those around you. Make an effort to step-aside, or pass others quickly and courteously on sidewalks.  Passing someone on the sidewalk is not considered close contact or a significant risk for exposure to COVID-19. Remember to check in with others by phone or other technology. Support your neighbours if you can. Check in with yourself too. It’s ok not to be ok, and I encourage you to reach out to the Distress Centre of Ottawa to connect with someone at 613-238-3311 if you need help or are having trouble coping. Each of our efforts are needed as a community. The actions you take will affect not only you, but your loved ones and the most vulnerable people in our community. By acting now, you may be saving lives – the life of a family member, a neighbour, a friend, or a coworker. This is a difficult and challenging time for everyone, but we can do it. I’d like to thank you for your cooperation with physical (social) distancing from others and thank people who are helping each other. Supporting our neighbours is essential for us to make it through this pandemic. Please go to OttawaPublicHealth.ca and follow and share our updates on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Sincerely, Dr. Vera Etches March 27, 2020 - Special statement from Dr. Vera Etches, Medical Officer of Health Since Ottawa Public Health confirmed its first case of COVID-19 in Ottawa on March 11, our day-to-day lives have changed drastically. We know that staying home and practicing physical (social) distancing and being in self-isolation is not easy and we thank you for all you are doing to help flatten the curve. It is important to remember that this is a global issue and the response around the world has been immense to influence the impact of COVID-19. There are now more than 86,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States; this number is greater than the total number of cases in China and Italy. Confirmed cases are just the tip of the iceberg of the actual infections out there. Around this time of year, many travellers are returning from travel around the world, including many snowbirds returning to Canada from the US. Returning travelers from all destinations outside of Canada MUST self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days. Do not go shopping for groceries or supplies; these must be picked up by a family member or friend or through online ordering options.   Please visit our   for more instructions on how to self-isolate, including for specific scenarios. As of this morning, there are 75 confirmed cases in Ottawa. Included in these numbers is the first confirmed case in a retirement home in Ottawa. This case was confirmed at Promenade Seniors’ Suites & Retirement Residence in Orleans. The individual as well as their spouse, who is also a resident of the retirement home, have been hospitalized. The retirement home has implemented outbreak management and OPH is connecting with close contacts, as we do in all cases. All residents have been notified and are in self-solation. Staff at the home continue to be screened and have been instructed to wear personal protective equipment in the building, specifically wearing a mask when entering the building and following droplet/contact procedures in all resident rooms. The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care has increased. There are 17 people in hospital (including the two from the retirement home), seven of which are in intensive care. Of the people in intensive care, most are in their 50s and 60s, with only one individual older than 70. This is important for the public to appreciate as it demonstrates that the illness does not discriminate age – anyone is susceptible. Furthermore, 16 per cent of all the cases to date have no travel and no known contact with a confirmed case, demonstrating clear community spread. Ottawa Public Health continues to communicate and work closely with local hospitals, health care partners, businesses, the City and all levels of government to implement our community response to COVID-19.  Thank you again for your ongoing patience and cooperation in keeping residents informed. Please continue to visit:  March 26, 2020 at 2:30pm - Special statement from Dr. Vera Etches, Medical Officer of Health The situation around COVID-19 continues to evolve quickly, with new developments and new announcements daily from all levels of government. We continue to be grateful for media’s help in getting reliable, timely information out to our residents.   As of this morning, OPH is investigating 51 confirmed COVID-19 cases. We also shared the sad news late yesterday afternoon about Ottawa’s first COVID-19 related death. The individual was a man in his 90s who was living at home. He developed a fever on March 15th. He was seen in the emergency department of The Ottawa Hospital and admitted on March 20 and died on March 25, 2020. As with other people diagnosed with COVID-19, OPH will not be discussing any further details in order to protect personal health information. We continue to get questions about self-isolation. I want to reinforce that the information on our website provides clear guidelines. Returning travelers MUST self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days. DO NOT go shopping for groceries or supplies. Have those purchased for you by a friend, family or neighbour or use a delivery service. If you are self-isolating and develop symptoms or if you are awaiting test results for COVID-19, you must stay home. Do not leave your home except to seek medical treatment for escalating symptoms. If you are self-isolating and do not have symptoms, we want you to do everything you can to remain healthy and part of that involves, getting fresh air and exercise. Therefore, if you don’t have symptoms, it’s okay to go for a walk outside, but at all times, you must maintain a distance of at least 2 meters from anyone you may encounter on your walk. I was happy to see this message reinforced by Health Minister Hajdu yesterday during a press conference and by Dr. Theresa Tam on Twitter last night. We want you to stay healthy and be able to go outside to get some fresh air, while practicing physical distancing. Also, please remember to wash your hands thoroughly before and after any outdoor excursion or activity. It’s important to remember that while those most at risk of severe complications from COVID-19 are older adults and those with underlying health conditions, I want to reiterate that COVID19 does not discriminate. We can expect serious illness across all age categories, and everyone has a role when it comes to physical/social distancing. We know this situation is causing stress and anxiety in our community. I’m happy to share with you that OPH has added a new section on our coronavirus webpage to make it easier for residents to find mental health resources in our community. We also recognize that the volume of new information can be overwhelming. Please note that the team at Ottawa Public Health is continuously updating our website and messaging to provide residents with the latest and most reliable information on how to protect themselves and their loved ones and maintain their health. Thank you again for your ongoing patience and cooperation in keeping residents informed. Please continue to visit:  March 24, 2020 at 2:15pm - Special statement from Dr. Vera Etches, Medical Officer of Health Firstly, I want to ensure that everyone heard the news that The Ontario Ministry of Health has a new enhanced self-assessment tool online.  If you think you have coronavirus symptoms, or have been in close contact with someone who has it, use this online self-assessment to help determine how to seek further care and receive recommendations to either continue physical (social) distancing or self-isolate. Moving forward, you will also begin to hear the use of the term “physical distancing” instead of “social distancing.”  This language is beginning to be used around the world and is clearer about what we are recommending to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  We want residents to keep a physical distance of at least 2 metres from others, but not to disconnect socially.  It is very important during this time, that we maintain social connections to support our mental health; however, these social connections with people outside your household should be done through phone calls and other technology as much as possible.    Regarding gathering more information on whether people are adhering to social distancing.  In the short term, we are using more traditional means: we are planning a population survey, through a phone survey that will be implemented in the next few days.  We are exploring all options to use technology to assist with the response, but have no plans to implement cell phone proximity tracking or social media mining. Exploring some of these options would need to be done in a transparent way to be sure that privacy is protected and there is evidence the tools work the way we’d want them to. As of this morning, OPH is investigating 25 confirmed cases and 13 indeterminate cases.  We anticipate this number will continue to increase as more people are exposed to the virus in our community and are getting tested.  Regarding testing, we are actively working with our laboratory and health care partners to improve their wait times to receiving results.  Currently we are hearing that the average wait time for results is 7 days. We are working with our healthcare partners to ramp up their efforts to process samples locally as part of a more sustainable model.   We appreciate your patience and request that you not call Ottawa Public Health for test results. If you are tested at the Assessment Centre, please follow their guidance on how to receive your results through their on-line mechanisms. For those individuals that have received testing and need clarity while they are waiting for results, the guidance is consistent with what we are recommending for self-isolation.  For example: Thank you for continuing to share this information and please visit our website regularly for the latest updates:  .   It has been another busy start to our week as the information, and measures at all levels of government in response to this pandemic, are changing rapidly. We are working around the clock to provide information to the public as soon as possible.  As of this morning, OPH is investigating 22 confirmed cases and 11 indeterminate cases. I know there is always a lot of interest in how many confirmed cases are in our community, but we know that these cases are really only one small part of the COVID-19 response.  As I mentioned yesterday, we now have laboratory confirmation of community spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Ottawa and that there could be up to 4,000 cases in Ottawa. I want to take the time to help people understand how we determine these estimates. Researchers at the University of Toronto developed a model that describes COVID-19 transmission based on a model that was used in 2009 for H1N1 pandemic planning in Canada. This model tries to take into account that: The model is used as a planning tool, to help predict healthcare resources needed, and potential positive impacts of strategies, such as physical (social) distancing and school closures. It helps us make comparisons between types of interventions versus no interventions. It is approximate, and daily numbers will fluctuate. For example, the model shouldn’t be used to say we will have X number of cases on March 23 or June 10; it should be used to see how interventions may impact estimated number of cases over time. The model estimates, based on having 27 diagnosed cases on Sunday, that there are between 200 and 4,000 total diagnosed and undiagnosed cases in Ottawa now. We released the number publicly to help raise awareness that COVID-19 is in our community, and to communicate that we all need to do our part to slow down transmission of infection by limiting our contact with others.  We just received an updated model, so we are still working to understand how to apply that to the current situation in Ottawa. The model isn’t going to give us perfect numbers that I can provide into the future, because interventions are changing.  Instead, we are continuing to work on data sources that will give us a better picture of what is happening in our community.  For example, we are looking at emergency room visits for fever and cough, we are looking at ways to ask people to report to us if they have fever and cough in the community.  We also want more information on whether people are adhering to physical (social) distancing guidance in our community.  All of the additional information sources we are building will help build a better picture and more precise projections of where we are at on the “curve” of infections in our community. We will continue to share more information about the number of estimated infections in the community as our surveillance systems evolve. We are working toward adding this information on our website so it is available to the public and the media, and importantly to our health system partners as this information helps them with health system planning over the next several months.   Given this information about community spread, we all need to be vigilant to continue physical (social) distancing.  Now is not the time for non-essential excursions outside the home or for having friends and family over to visit. Overall, physical (social) distancing means to limit the total number of people you come in close contact with; ideally you are able to limit your contact to only people within your household. Limit contact with everyone outside your household unless you have essential work, or if you need important support from one other person.  So this means, that you should only be connecting with friends and family virtually and to limit how often you go to the grocery store.  When you do go outside of your homes, to go for a walk or to get groceries, keep at least 2 metres distance apart from others.  Parks remain open, but we ask that you do not congregate in parks, on sports fields, courts and playgrounds – again all to limit your close contacts with anyone outside your household.  Essentially, physical (social) distancing and keeping two meters distance from others applies to all setting when other people are around. The additional measures announced earlier today by the province of Ontario, that there will be a mandatory closure of all non-essential work places, will help limit these non-essential outings.  We will be working with our City colleagues to determine local implications, but please be reassured that we will have access to food, utilities and essential products.  In my statement yesterday, I encouraged that people should not visit non-essential businesses including but not limited to clothing retail stores, hair and nail salons, tattoo parlours, gym and fitness facilities, banquet halls and conference centres; we will share the list of businesses permitted to stay open once released tomorrow by the province.  Many people are returning home from travel and will need groceries and essential items. It is imperative that all returning travellers self-isolate for 14 days.  If you are self-isolating it means that; groceries and essential items should be picked up by a family member or friend, or acquired through on-line ordering options. We are working with the airport to ensure all travellers are aware of this information about self-isolation.  Having a COVID-19 test result or not does not change the actions that individuals in the community need to take now. If you have travelled or are ill with a respiratory illness, stay home – and for all of us, now is the time to limit our interactions with others outside of our household as much as possible.  We continue to have many questions about what self-isolation actually means. Self-isolation means you need to stay home and avoid contact with others. People who are self-isolating,  , can continue to go outside for a walk or to a local greenspace; however, I can’t say this enough - they should not gather with others and it is essential they keep 2 metres away from others.  It is important that individuals who are self-isolating have no contact with anyone other than household members. Guidance for residents who are self-isolating is available on our website, as well as information about cleaning your home, personal hygiene, laundry and waste disposal.  Thank you for continuing to share this information and please visit our website regularly for the latest updates:  .  Because most cases are mild and undetected, Ottawa Public Health is urging everyone to practice social distancing. More information on social distancing for you and your family can be found on our website. Our efforts are needed as a community. The actions you take will affect not only you but your loved ones and our most vulnerable. While we appreciate that people are thinking of their loved ones, now is not the time to visit them in person. Luckily, we have technology on our side which enables us to communicate in other creative ways like video chats and group phone calls. Now is also not the time for non-essential excursions. We are working with the City of Ottawa to provide greater clarity on what we consider non-essential vs essential businesses here in Ottawa. People should not visit non-essential businesses including but not limited to clothing retail stores, hair and nail salons, tattoo parlours, gym and fitness facilities, banquet halls and conference centres. Many people are returning home from March Break travel and will need groceries and essential items. It is imperative that all returning travellers self-isolate for 14 days, so groceries and essential items should be picked up by a family member or friend, or through on-line ordering options. Visit our website for further guidance on self-isolation. We have been working with the Ottawa International Airport to ensure this is being communicated clearly to returning travellers. Social distancing is important for everyone at this time, but especially important for members of our older adult community and our most vulnerable. Here are some ways that you and your family can practise social distancing:  Our community partners are working together through the City’s Human Needs Task Force for those requiring assistance. The Good Companions are offering Seniors Centre Without Walls, where seniors can dial in and partake in a virtual centre with activities. The Ottawa Food Bank and community food banks are all working hard to ensure food is still available to those that need it. For more information on how to connect to these wonderful services, residents can call 2-1-1. Information is changing rapidly and we are working around the clock to provide information to the public as soon as possible. Please continue to share this information and visit our website regularly for the latest updates:  The past week has seen a very quick escalation from all levels of government in response to the COVID-19 situation. I want to publicly respond to a few common questions and concerns to help provide clarity on our approach at the local level. As a reminder, please visit our website OttawaPublicHealth.ca/Coronavirus for local information about COVID-19, including assessment and testing in Ottawa, self-isolation and social distancing. Due to high call volumes please try to not call unless you have read the website first. Testing and Assessment The present goals of testing for COVID-19 are to detect the virus in our community and also limit the spread of the virus. Lab testing helps us estimate cases in the community. For each laboratory-confirmed case related to travel, there is a likelihood that at least an equal number of travel-related cases are undetected. Based on current confirmed cases, whose onset of illness is in the past, there could potentially be anywhere between 200 to 1000 undetected cases in the community now. We do not yet have laboratory-confirmed community spread, though we do see cases giving rise to cases in close contacts.  With this information, I am communicating to all people in Ottawa that we need to act as if the virus is here, circulating in our community. The testing isn’t able to track down each case in our community because the mild illness the majority of people experience is not distinguishable from common colds and we cannot test large numbers. Having a COVID-19 test result or not does not change the actions that individuals in the community need to take – if ill with a respiratory illness, stay home – and for all of us, now is the time to limit our interactions with others as much as possible. The current COVID-19 testing provides a pulse check and helps us make decisions about our next steps to control the spread of COVID-19. It also helps limit spread COVID-19 by the highest risk cases. Self-isolation and social distancing are effective strategies for slowing the spread at the community level. Check our website to learn more about when to self-isolate and when to go for testing: OttawaPublicHealth.ca/Coronavirus. You do not need a referral from Ottawa Public Health to get tested for COVID-19. At a high level: If you are a return traveler (including travel to the United States of America) OR have MILD symptoms – you MUST self-isolate. Most people with MILD symptoms will recover at home with no issues. You are helping limit the spread of the virus by staying at home. For now (this may change), our priority is to test people with escalating symptoms AND travel history within 14 days OR close contact with someone with COVID-19. We are also prioritizing ruling out COVID-19 in workers, such as health-care workers or Long-Term Care Homes. In the future, the goals of COVID-19 testing are likely to shift towards being used to limit outbreaks in settings of high risk. The focus of testing would turn to health care and essential workers, hospitalized patients, long-term care homes, correctional facilities and other situations where the result is helpful to direct public health actions. Social Distancing Social distancing refers to creating physical distance between ourselves so that we can limit the spread of the virus. Social distancing by all is IMPERATIVE to limit transmission in the community, to protect vulnerable populations and outbreaks in institutions. We must “flatten the curve” so we don’t see spikes in cases. By this, I mean that we want to slow down transmission of the virus and lessen the number of cases in the community that happen at the same time, so that our health system continues to work properly. Having a sharp increase of cases in a small timeframe will overload our healthcare resources and have more severe impacts on our community. Social distancing is important for everyone at this time, but especially important for our older adult community (55+). Do NOT gather in groups of 10 or more. Practice social distancing. Social distancing does not mean emotional distancing. Check in with others by phone or other technology. Check in with yourself. It’s ok not to be ok. Please know that help is available, and we encourage you to reach out to Distress Centre of Ottawa to connect with someone at 613-238-3311 if needed. Case Management and Privacy We have received many questions from people who feel they are at risk, including many people expressing concern about being in the same location as someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or who may have symptoms of COVID-19. I would like to clarify a few points: Regarding privacy, Ottawa Public Health will not comment about any specifics around an individual case of COVID-19. We encourage others to not pursue this information unless an individual issues their own statement to this effect. Ottawa Public Health will contact you directly if you are a close contact. The reportable information that we are required to share with the Ministry of Health, and which is on their website: I have been made aware that certain residents have received a phone call asking for credit card information from Ottawa Public Health (OPH). OPH (or any health unit) will not ask you for credit card information. Do not give your credit card information out if you receive a call or message similar to this. Fraudulent activity during a situation like this is deplorable. I encourage you to report it to Ottawa Police Services.  Gratitude Thank you to all residents of the City of Ottawa for your ongoing patience and cooperation. We are all in this together, and we need everyone to do their part- whether providing an essential service or staying inside – to be able to slow the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in our community and protect our health system and loved ones who depend on it. Dr. Vera Etches Medical Officer of Health Ottawa Public Health   He also advised the following establishments should close temporarily (until further notice): Other establishments also strongly recommended by Ottawa Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Vera Etches, include: Therefore, I am asking all people in Ottawa to increase their practices of social distancing. This means limiting non-essential trips out of the home and making efforts to maintain a distance of 1 to 2 metres from other people as much as possible. We are asking people to, if possible, keep their children home from daycare and to check with their employers about options for working from home or implementing social distancing at work. These guidelines are not meant to say “you must stay in your home!” You can still go outside to take a walk, go to the park, or walk your dog. If you need groceries, go to the store. We simply recommend that while outside you make sure to avoid crowds and maintain a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3-6 feet) from those around you. I know there will be many questions and significant hardship associated with implementation of these measures. They are necessary to limit COVID-19 transmission in our community.  We each need to do our part to ensure that our healthcare providers have the capacity to provide life saving measures for all, and to care for the most vulnerable people. Social distancing measures can make a huge difference to slow the rapid spread of illness. While you may not feel sick, please be mindful of the members of our community who are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than others. We are all in this together. The Ottawa Public Health website has been updated with information about social distancing to provide further guidance to the public. Information is changing rapidly and we are working to provide this information to the public as soon as possible. Please continue to share this information.

A half-dozen U.S. states in the South and West reported one-day records for   deaths on Tuesday and cases in Texas passed the 400,000 mark as California health officials said Latinos made up more than half its cases. Arkansas, California, Florida, Montana, Oregon and Texas each reported record spikes in fatalities. In the United States more than 1,300 lives were lost nation wide on Tuesday, the biggest one-day increase since May, according to a Reuters tally. 
 
 California health officials said Latinos, who make up just over a third of the most populous U.S. state, account for 56 per cent of COVID-19 infections and 46 per cent of deaths. Cases are soaring in the Central Valley agricultural region, with its heavily Latino population, overwhelming hospitals. The state on Tuesday reported 171 deaths. Florida saw 191 coronavirus deaths in the prior 24 hours, the state health department said. Texas added more than 6,000 new cases on Monday, pushing its total to 401,477, according to a Reuters tally. Only three other states — California, Florida and New York — have more than 400,000 total cases. The four are the most populous U.S. states. California and Texas both reported decreases in overall hospitalizations as Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top U.S. infectious diseases expert, saw signs the surge could be peaking in the South and West while other areas were on the cusp of new outbreaks. Fauci said early indications showed the percentage of positive coronavirus tests rising in Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee and Kentucky. The rise in U.S. deaths and infections has dampened early hopes the country was past the worst of an economic crisis that has decimated businesses and put millions of Americans out of work. The trend has fueled a bitter debate over the reopening of schools in the coming weeks. President Donald Trump and members of his administration have pushed for students to return to class, while some teachers and local officials have called for online learning. 
 
 “We will fight on all fronts for the safety of students and their educators,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said during the union’s virtual convention on Tuesday. “It’s the 11th hour; we need the resources now.” The Texas Education Agency, the state’s overseer of public education, said it would deny funding to schools that delay in-person classes because of orders by local health authorities related to the pandemic. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued guidance that health authorities cannot impose “blanket” school closures for coronavirus prevention. Any such decision is up to school officials, he said. Local health leaders in the biggest metropolitan areas in Texas, including Houston and Dallas, have recently ordered the postponement of in-person classes. In Washington, some Republicans in the U.S. Senate pushed back against their own party’s $1 trillion coronavirus relief proposal the day after it was unveiled by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, weighing on U.S. stocks. “I’m not for borrowing another trillion dollars,” Republican Senator Rand Paul told reporters. Democrats have rejected the plan as too limited compared with their $3 trillion proposal that passed the House of Representatives in May. Some Republicans called it too expensive. Trump said on Tuesday he did not support everything in the Senate Republican coronavirus relief legislation but would not elaborate. 
 
 “There are also things that I very much support,” he told a White House briefing. “But we’ll be negotiating.” Trump also groused about Fauci’s high approval ratings and joked “nobody likes me” as he struggles to improve his standing with voters over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. “It can only be my personality,” said Trump.

Countries around the world step up efforts to tackle the new coronavirus that has killed hundreds of thousands. Countries around the world are scrambling to halt the spread of the  . As of July 27, more than 654,000 people worldwide have died of COVID-19, the highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. The number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 has reached over 16.4 million, according to   compiled by Johns Hopkins University. More than 9.5 million people have recovered. Here is what you need to know:  the World Health Organization (WHO), coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). These viruses were originally transmitted from animals to people. SARS, for instance, was transmitted from civet cats to humans while MERS moved to humans from a type of camel. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. The name coronavirus comes from the Latin word corona, meaning crown or halo. Under an electron microscope, the virus looks like it is surrounded by a solar corona. The novel coronavirus, identified by Chinese authorities on January 7 and since named  , is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans. Little is known about it, although human-to-human transmission  . According to the WHO, signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Other signs include loss of taste or smell as well as muscle aches. In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and even death. Read more on what the coronavirus does to your body if you catch it  . The number of fatalities from the new coronavirus has overwhelmingly surpassed the toll of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, which also originated in China. MERS, which did not spread as widely, was more deadly, killing one-third of those infected. While the new coronavirus is more widespread than SARS in terms of case numbers, the mortality rate remains considerably lower at approximately 3.4 percent, according to the WHO. People who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes also seem to be at high risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. Since March 16, more cases were registered outside mainland China than inside, marking a new milestone in the spread of the global pandemic.  The virus has spread from China all around the world, prompting the WHO to label the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Human-to-human transmissions became evident after cases were recorded with no apparent link to China. Read about which countries have confirmed cases  . Scientists around the globe are   but have warned it is not likely one will be available for mass distribution before 2021. Meanwhile, a growing number of countries have introduced a series of sweeping measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including nationwide lockdowns, bans on gatherings, closure of schools, restaurants, bars and sports clubs, as well as issuing mandatory work-from-home decrees.   International airlines   the world over. Some countries have banned non-citizens from entering their territories, and several more have evacuated their citizens from abroad. Chinese health authorities are still trying to determine the origin of the virus, which they say likely came from a seafood market in Wuhan, China where wildlife was also traded illegally. On February 7, Chinese researchers said the virus could have spread from an infected animal species to humans through illegally-trafficked pangolins, which are prized in Asia for food and medicine. Scientists have pointed to either bats or snakes as possible sources of the virus.  Yes, this outbreak is a global health emergency,  , raising the alarm further on March 11 when it  . The international health alert is a call to countries around the world to coordinate their response under the guidance of the WHO. There have been five global health emergencies since 2005 when the declaration was formalised: swine flu in 2009, polio in 2014, Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and Ebola again in 2019. Smoking can make people more susceptible to serious complications from a coronavirus infection, the European Union agency for disease control said. In its updated assessment of the risks caused by the coronavirus, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) included smokers among those potentially most vulnerable to COVID-19. Smokers have also appeared to be more susceptible to breathing complications caused by the disease, and the ECDC said it was advisable to identify them as a potential vulnerable group, confirming an earlier assessment. The agency cited a study by Chinese doctors which on a sample of 99 patients affected by the coronavirus found that acute smokers were more at risk of dying than elderly people. The ECDC report also said smoking was associated with heightened activity in the lungs of an enzyme, ACE2, that could make patients more vulnerable to COVID-19, citing a study conducted by Guoshuai Cai, from the University of South Carolina. The activity of ACE2, or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, also increases with age and with some kinds of hypertension treatment - both risk factors - the ECDC said.

These droplets spread by: People who have COVID-19 can spread it to others before they start to feel sick. COVID-19 is not widely spread by being airborne, which means it doesn’t stay in the air long and won’t go very far. But if you are too close to someone with COVID-19 you can get sick by breathing in air that contains droplets with the virus. We think the virus generally only survives for a few hours on a surface or object, but it may be possible for it to survive several days under some conditions. COVID-19 can cause serious respiratory illness. Because it is a new virus with no treatment or immunity in people, it is important for people with any symptoms to stay home and isolate to keep it from spreading. Most people – about 80% – recover without needing special treatment. However, it can cause serious illness in some, and there is a risk of death in severe cases. While we are still learning about COVID-19, serious illness appears to develop more often in people who are older or have pre-existing conditions, such as: There is no vaccine or proven treatment for COVID-19 at this time. The virus is new and different, so needs its own vaccine – which researchers around the world are now working to develop. Supportive care is being used to treat patients with COVID-19 and some medications are being tested to see if they can help severely ill patients. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause respiratory illness in people, ranging from mild common colds to severe illnesses. Novel coronaviruses, like COVID-19, are new strains of the virus that have not been previously identified in humans. This means people have no immunity against it, and it has no vaccine or proven treatment. In some ways, COVID-19 is similar to influenza (also known as the flu), but there are also key differences.

The update, which was announced in Toronto Public Health’s  , marks the fewest new cases seen in any single day in the city since March 10 — well before the pandemic reached its first peak in Ontario in mid-April. Case counts have fallen sharply in the city this month. According to Toronto Public Health, the city has seen a total of 15,338 infected patients, of whom 13,785 have since recovered. Another two patients have died since Monday’s update, the health unit says.  Ontario Premier Doug Ford says there are no plans to pull any regions back a step in the province’s economic reopening process despite new outbreaks in some areas that have moved into Stage 3. Ford says the new cases don’t amount to a serious spike and he will rely on the advice of the province’s health-care command table in making any decisions related to the COVID-19 recovery plan. The province is slated to make an announcement Wednesday on when Windsor-Essex, Toronto and nearby Peel Region will progress to Stage 3, which allows nearly every business and public space to reopen with health restrictions in place and increases the permissible size of social gatherings.  The Miami Marlins’ coronavirus outbreak   Dr. Anthony Fauci said, as the number of their players testing positive rose to 15. The Marlins received positive test results for four additional players Tuesday, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press. The person declined to be identified because the results had not been publicly released. Nine players on the 30-man roster, two taxi squad players and two staff members tested positive earlier, stranding the team in Philadelphia and prompting the postponement of four MLB games. The Marlins underwent another round of tests Tuesday morning. Their outbreak raised anew questions about MLB’s attempts to conduct a season outside of bubble environment, which the NFL also has opted not to create for its season. “This could put it in danger,” Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said of the outbreak. “I don’t believe they need to stop, but we just need to follow this and see what happens with other teams on a day-by-day basis.” Toronto medical officer of health Dr. Eileen de Villa is recommending strict measures for bars when they reopen, including mandatory staff screening, customer contact logs and table size limits.  Canada’s chief medical officer Dr. Theresa Tam says active discussions are taking place to potentially pre-order COVID-19 vaccine doses for Canadians. Tam says an independent vaccine task force is advising the government on options for Canada’s choice of vaccine, including exploring the possibility of manufacturing a potential pandemic cure at home. Tam was addressing concerns that Canadians will have to get in line behind other countries to wait for the COVID-19 vaccine. One senator and some health-care professionals are asking why Ottawa is delaying a decision on the $35-million pitch by Toronto-based Providence Therapeutics to begin human trials of a new, experimental vaccine technology that has been heavily funded in the United States. Providence says it could deliver five million doses of a vaccine to Canadians by mid-2021 if its trials bear fruit, but it can’t move forward with testing or manufacturing without funding. Tam also says there has been a worrisome rise in COVID-19 infections that may have been fuelled by Canada Day parties. Health officials on Prince Edward Island say there are no active cases of COVID-19 in the province. Dr. Heather Morrison, the chief medical officer of health, said today all 36 cases confirmed by authorities since the start of the pandemic are considered recovered. Morrison adds that residents of long-term care homes can now name someone to assist in their care, such as a spouse, relative or friend. They can also go for a drive with that person. Long-term care residents are still only permitted two visitors at a time, but the list of designated visitors is no longer limited to six people. Morrison says she is encouraged by the number of Islanders wearing masks, adding that people still need to observe other health directives such as physical distancing and regular hand-washing.  Quebec is reporting an additional 169 COVID-19 cases today in addition to three new deaths linked to the virus. The number of new infections has remained stable in recent days, and the provincial government said Monday the majority of cases have involved people in the 15-to-34 age bracket. Of the deaths reported today, two were new and one occurred before July 20, bringing the total to 5,670. The number of hospitalizations in the province continued to decline, down to 193 patients from 200 a day earlier. Of those, eight patients are in intensive care, an increase of one. The province has had a total of 58,897 COVID-19 cases, and it performed 9,442 tests on Sunday — the last day for which numbers are available. Ontario is reporting 111 new cases of COVID-19, and four new deaths related to the novel coronavirus. The total number of cases now stands at 38,910, which includes 2,768 deaths and 34,567 resolved cases. There were 106 new resolved cases reported. Health Minister Christine Elliott says 27 of the province’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases, with 16 reporting none. She says Ottawa accounts for 25 of them, with 22 more in Windsor-Essex and six in Toronto. The provincial government said it was able to complete 17,334 tests the previous day. It also said 96 people are in hospital — up 14 — because of the virus, including 31 people in intensive care and 18 on ventilators. Donald Trump Jr.’s Twitter account has been temporarily suspended after the president’s eldest son shared a video of a group of people touting hydroxychloroquine as an effective treatment for Covid-19. The Food and Drug Administration last month revoked emergency use authorization for the drug after determining it may have deadly side effects, and the World Health Organization also said it would discontinue its own tests of hydroxychloroquine. After an adviser to Trump Jr. reported the suspension, Twitter issued a statement saying the move was not permanent, but that the tweet “requires deletion because it violates our rules (sharing misinformation on COVID-19), and the account will have limited functionality for 12 hours.” The New York Yankees-Philadelphia Phillies games was postponed Tuesday for the second straight day, The Associated Press reports. The Phillies were waiting for complete results from their COVID-19 tests following an outbreak among the Miami Marlins, who played a weekend series in Philadelphia.  The Yankees are scheduled to host the Phillies on Wednesday and Thursday. More than a dozen Marlins players and staff members tested positive for COVID-19 in an outbreak that stranded the team in Philadelphia on Sunday, disrupting MLB’s schedule in the early days of the pandemic-delayed season. Miami’s home opener against Baltimore was postponed, as was Tuesday’s finale of the two-game series at Marlins Park.  U.S. consumer confidence tumbled in July to a reading of 92.6 as coronavirus infections spread in many parts of the country. The Conference Board, a New York-based research organization, reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell from a June reading of 98.3. The weakness came from a drop in the expectations index, which measures consumer views about the short-term outlook for income, business and labour market conditions. The consumer confidence index is closely watched for signals it can send about future consumer spending, which accounts for 70 per cent of economic activity. North American stock markets dipped in early morning trading while gold settled down after setting another record high. The S&P/TSX composite index was down 53.09 points at 16,108.24. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 108.20 points at 26,476.57. The S&P 500 index was down 7.49 points at 3,231.92, while the Nasdaq composite was down 42.34 points at 10,493.93. Donald Trump Jr.’s Twitter account has been temporarily suspended after he posted a video of doctors talking about hydroxychloroquine. The number of people looking for employment through Nigeria’s biggest recruiting website has jumped five-fold since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the struggle faced by many in Africa’s largest economy. “Typically we have about 10,000 active job-seekers a week,” Hilda Kragha, Jobberman’s chief executive officer, said in interview in Lagos, the country’s financial capital. “During this pandemic, we have been having over 55,000, which means more people are looking for jobs.” Like many countries Nigeria has been hit hard economically after implementing lockdowns to contain the spread of coronavirus. Africa’s top oil producer was also reeling from a collapse in crude prices earlier in the year and is suffering from rampant dollar shortages. Combined they have exacerbated the strain on a wide range of businesses in a country that has long struggled to provide jobs for its young population. The data from Jobberman, which recruits mainly white-collar employees and doesn’t track those looking for non-skilled, blue-collar work, chimes with official estimates that sees unemployment in the nation of more than 200 million soaring to 34 per cent by the end of the year from 23 per cent in 2019. A week after appearing to project a more serious tone about the coronavirus, President Donald Trump is back to pushing unproven claims that an anti-malaria drug is an effective treatment and challenging the credibility of the nation’s leading infectious disease expert. Dr. Anthony Fauci pushed back Tuesday, saying he will keep doing his job. Numerous studies, meanwhile, have shown that the drug, hydroxychloroquine, is not an effective treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently withdrew an order that allowed the drug’s use as a emergency treatment for COVID-19. Yet overnight, after returning from a trip to North Carolina where he promoted efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, Trump retweeted a series of tweets advocating for hydroxychloroquine. The president also shared a post from the Twitter account for a podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, a former top White House adviser to Trump, accusing Fauci of misleading the public over hydroxychloroquine. Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, pushed back Tuesday during an appearance on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “I go along with the FDA,” said Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.” Real Madrid forward Mariano has tested positive for the coronavirus, the club said Tuesday. The announcement came as the team returned to practice ahead of its Champions League match against Manchester City on Aug. 7. Real Madrid lost at home 2-1 in the first leg of the round-of-16 series. Madrid said Mariano was in “perfect health condition” and was following health protocols. He was confined at his home, the club said. The entire Madrid squad was tested for COVID-19 on Monday. The players had been on a break of almost 10 days after winning the Spanish league title — the club’s first in three years. The club said players “returned to work under strict health safety guidelines because of the COVID-19 pandemic.” The 26-year-old Mariano played only a few matches with Madrid this season. His last had been against Getafe in the Spanish league on July 2.  The French government has maintained a maximum capacity of 5,000 fans in stadiums until the end of August amid the coronavirus pandemic. French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu says the decision was taken because France has seen an increase in coronavirus cases recently. But Maracineanu adds that local officials will have the authority to increase the capacity at some events from Aug. 15 if they can obtain special dispensation and observe strict health and safety protocol. Only 2,805 fans attended the French Cup final between Paris Saint-Germain and Saint-Etienne last Friday but the number was low because Saint-Etienne fans did not use their allocation of 900 seats at Stade de France. PSG faces Lyon in the League Cup final at the same stadium on Friday. The co-founders of WE Charity are to testify before a House of Commons committee Tuesday as part of a parliamentary probe into a $912-million student-volunteer program. Brothers Craig and Marc Kielburger, who helped found the organization two decades ago, are scheduled to speak this afternoon with MPs on the finance committee. In a statement last week, the brothers said they agreed to testify to set the record straight about their involvement in the Canada Student Service Grant program. WE Charity backed out of administering the program in early July amid a controversy over the Liberals’ awarding the organization a sole-sourced contract despite its close ties to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The controversy for the government has only deepened since, as the federal ethics watchdog has launched probes of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau over their involvement in cabinet decisions despite WE’s having paid Trudeau’s family members speaking fees, and Morneau’s familial ties to the group. Further compounding problems for the finance minister was his admission last week that he had just repaid the organization more than $41,000 in travel expenses for WE-sponsored trips he and his family took three years ago. Pfizer reported a 32 per cent plunge in second-quarter profit, mainly due to the global coronavirus pandemic limiting marketing of and new prescriptions for its medicines. Pfizer had predicted in April that the virus would keep both patients and company sales representatives away from doctors and hospitals. Still, the biggest U.S. drugmaker by revenue posted a solid profit and nudged up parts of its 2020 financial forecast and reaffirmed the rest. The maker of the world’s top-selling vaccine, Prevnar 13 for preventing ear infections, pneumonia and related bacterial diseases, noted that the pandemic restricted doctor visits, prescriptions for new medicines and vaccination rates for many of its shots. However, it boosted sales of its medicines used to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The new cases in the central city of Da Nang are the first confirmed to be locally transmitted in the country in over three months. Public transport into and out of Da Nang was cancelled. Over the weekend, thousands of mostly Vietnamese tourists cut short their summer holidays in the popular beach destination. The lockdown has dealt a hard blow to the city’ tourism industry, which was just being revived after earlier coronavirus cases mostly subsided at the end of April. Hotel guests quickly ended their stays and cancelled upcoming trips upon the news of the first case, one hotelier said on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. NHL hockey returns today after a months-long hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Montreal Canadiens are in Toronto to take on the Maple Leafs and the Edmonton Oilers meet the Calgary Flames at Rogers Place as part of today’s three-game exhibition schedule that kicks off Phase 4 of the league’s return-to-play plan. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers square off in Toronto in today’s other game. Edmonton and Toronto are serving as hub cities for the 24 NHL teams that are returning to action, though the Canadiens and Flames are listed as the home teams tonight.  The biggest test yet of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine got underway Monday with the first of some 30,000 Americans rolling up their sleeves to receive shots created by the U.S. government as part of the all-out global race to stop the pandemic. The glimmer of hope came even as Google, in one of the gloomiest assessments of the coronavirus’s staying power from a major employer, decreed that most of its 200,000 employees and contractors should work from home through next June — a decision that could influence other big companies. Final-stage testing of the vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., began with volunteers at numerous sites around the U.S. given either a real dose or a dummy without being told which. As the clock ticks down to September, a new poll suggests many Canadian parents are on the fence about whether to send their kids to school if and when classrooms are reopened. The poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies comes as provincial governments are working on how to get students back into classrooms, most of which have been shuttered since mid-March due to COVID-19. Toronto is “very close” to securing federal funding so people who are have COVID-19 and risk infection other at home could soon self-isolate in a free room with food, laundry and Wi-Fi for up to two weeks. Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto’s senior public health official, is asking city council this week to authorize her to enter into an agreement with the federal government to fund a 140-room, city-run “isolation site.” The  , modelled on that of  , is aimed at lower-income people who get infected but, because of crowded living conditions and other factors, can’t ensure they won’t spread the virus to others. No site has yet been confirmed. The city estimates it would cost $12.7 million to operate a 140-room facility for one year.  Coun. Joe Cressy, chair of the Toronto Public Health, said Toronto is “very close” to getting federal funding, calling the project an excellent investment in preventing a major second wave of COVID-19. . With just 23 new COVID-19 infections reported in the region Monday, the GTA has seen the fewest new cases in any day in more than five months, according to the Star’s latest count. It’s been 131 days since March 18 — the last time the GTA’s five local health units reported fewer than 25 new infections, well before the worst of the pandemic took hold in Ontario. At the time, just a single Ontarian had yet died of virus; more than 40,000 in the province have been infected since. As of 5 p.m. Monday, Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 40,873 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,799 deaths, up 150 cases in 24 hours.  As has been the case in recent days, the new infections reported Monday predominantly came outside the GTA. Inside the region, Toronto reported just five new cases Monday — its fewest since the second week of March — York and Durham regions one each, and Halton Region once again reported no new infections. Just Peel Region, which has seen case counts fall more slowly than elsewhere, reported in the double digits, with 16 new cases. Elsewhere, both Windsor-Essex — 41 cases — and Ottawa — 28 — continued to report the worst rates of new infection. Both health units have seen notable jumps in cases in July.  The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate  , but have not yet received a positive lab test. The province also cautions its data, published daily at 10:30 a.m., may be  , saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.” Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

 Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause a range of illnesses in humans, from the common cold to SARS. Viruses of this family also cause a number of animal diseases. On December 31, 2019 the WHO China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The outbreak began in a seafood and poultry market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. Like SARS and MERS-CoV, the newly detected coronavirus has a zoonotic source, however, human to human transmission has been confirmed. On March 11, 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 viral disease a pandemic. As of July 24, 2020 total of 15,578,624 confirmed cases caused by the novel Coronavirus COVID-19 and 634,744 deaths were reported. At this time 188 countries are reporting cases of the novel Coronavirus. For a full listing of affected countries refer to  Source:   (Johns Hopkins University). As of July 23, 2020, a total of 112,672 confirmed cases caused by the novel Coronavirus COVID-19 and 8,874 deaths were reported in Canada. An   is available. For real time information refer to the: Provided by: Public Health Agency of Canada Source:  The first human infections in China must have occurred in November 2019 or earlier. The first 59 suspected cases at the end of December 2019 and early January 2020 were admitted to Jinyintan Hospital, which was specially designated to isolate them. On January 23, 2020, Chinese authorities closed off the city, canceling planes and trains leaving Wuhan and suspending buses, subways and ferry services.  A second city in China, Huanggang was also placed in lockdown. On January 24, 2020 travel was restricted to a total of 10 cities, affecting 50 million people. Public bus, railway and airline operations were also suspended in these cities. On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the novel coronavirus is considered a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee announcement this decision due to concern for further global spread after person-to-person spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was confirmed in 4 countries (Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the United States) outside of China. As for February 5, 2020, forty major airlines around the world have canceled or reduced their flights to China until as late as March amid the coronavirus outbreak. On February 19 and 21, 2020; cases were reported in Iran and Italy respectively with no known direct link to Mainland China. On March 9, 2020 Italy expanded the quarantine from the Lombardy region to the entire country, as Italy’s case count surged. People throughout the country of 60 million were ordered not to travel other than for work or emergencies. South Korea and Iran have also imposed travel restrictions. On March 11, 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 viral disease a pandemic. As of May 13, 2020 the virus had spread to 188 countries with travel bans and restrictions implemented in many countries combined with various social distancing measures (ie. school, public space closures) in an effort to slow COVID-19 spread and flatten the epidemiological curve. Preliminary calculations for the average number of infections that each infected person may go on to cause, known as R . This is estimated to be 2.0 to 3.0 people per infected person. In comparison to seasonal flu, which usually has an R  of around 1.3.   The World Health Organization announced that the fatality rate in Wuhan, China, considered the epicenter of the outbreak, is between 2% and 4%. Outside of Wuhan, it is thought to be closer to 0.7%. In a recent   The overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%. No deaths occurred in those aged 9 years and younger, in those aged 70 to 79 years had an 8% fatality rate and those aged 80 years and older had a fatality rate of 14.8%. Children made up a 2.4% of the cases and almost none was severely ill. The fatality rate was 49% among critical cases, and elevated among those with preexisting conditions: 10.5% for people with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer. A   done by WHO and Chinese scientists has found that 80% of infected people had mild to moderate disease, 13.8% had severe symptoms, and 6.1% had life-threatening episodes of respiratory failure, septic shock, or organ failure. No deaths were reported among mild and severe cases. For the mild and moderate cases, it took 2 weeks on average to recover. Currently, randomized controlled clinical trials are being conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of its investigational antiviral compound remdesivir (GS-5734) against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Provincial/Territorial public health authorities should report confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 nationally to the Public Health Agency of Canada within 24 hours of their own notification. A person with symptoms that include two or more of:         And Or A person (who has had a laboratory test): And          Or A person (who has not had a laboratory test): And Close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19        Or In the 14 days before onset of illness, a person who:         Or          Or         Or Illnesses associated with the new coronavirus, named COVID-19, are similar to several respiratory illnesses and include fever, dry cough, sore throat and headache. Less frequent symptoms included coughing sputum or blood, headache and diarrhea. Most cases are considered mild to moderate with a subset experiencing more severe illness with shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Reported signs and symptoms include: Prior to any patient interaction, all healthcare workers (HCWs) have a responsibility to assess the infectious risk posed to themselves and to other patients, visitors, and HCWs. This risk assessment is based on professional judgment about the clinical situation and up-to-date information on how the specific healthcare organization has designed and implemented engineering and administrative controls, along with the availability and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Recommendations for infection prevention and control measures for patients presenting with suspected or confirmed infection or co-infection with COVID-19 in acute care settings include: : For all patients, at all times, in all healthcare settings including when performing a point-of-care risk assessment, and adherence to respiratory hygiene and hand hygiene.   : : When performing aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs). A respirator and face/eye protection should be used by all HCWs present in a room where an AGMP is being performed on a patient suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. Whenever possible, AGMPs should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room. As information becomes available, these recommendations will be re-evaluated and updated as needed.

As countries throughout the world begin to report COVID-19 spikes, recently opened borders are once again being closed. In Vietnam, travel into and out of the resort city of Danang was shut down early Tuesday, while in Europe, Britain and Germany recommended their citizens avoid the islands and beaches of Spain due to an increase in cases.  At the same time, the U.K. government's recommendation means that all travellers arriving in Britain from that country will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine. That move fanned uncertainty within Europe's tourism industry over how to plan ahead amid authorities' responses to new coronavirus outbreaks.  "Let's be absolutely clear about what's happening in Europe amongst some of our European friends. I'm afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said early Tuesday. He noted that there could be further changes to travel advice down the line affecting all of Europe.  Four U.S. states reported one-day records for coronavirus deaths on Tuesday and cases in Texas passed the 400,000 mark, stoking fears the United States was losing control of the outbreak. Arkansas, Florida, Montana and Oregon each reported record spikes in fatalities and California recorded 133 deaths by mid-afternoon, shy of its one-day peak of 159 with hours to go. In Washington, negotiations over the next coronavirus aid package are exposing a vast gulf between the Democrats' $3 trillion proposal and a $1 trillion counter-offer from the Republicans, with millions of Americans' jobless benefits, school reopenings and eviction protections at stake. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said on Tuesday no coronavirus relief bill will be brought to the Senate floor without legal liability protections included in the legislation. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said based on what she heard from McConnell in his press briefing she did not believe he was ready to reach an agreement on coronavirus relief legislation. It's unclear whether any agreement can be reached between Congress and U.S. President Donald Trump before Friday's deadline for expiring aid. The outcome will be a defining one for the president and the parties heading into the November election as an uneasy nation is watching and waiting for Washington to bring some end to the health crisis and devastating economic fallout. "We cannot afford to fail," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said as the chamber opened. At the White House, Trump reiterated unproven claims that an anti-malaria drug is an effective treatment and challenged the credibility of the nation's leading infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci. Numerous studies have shown that the drug, hydroxychloroquine, is not an effective treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently withdrew an order that allowed the drug's use as an emergency treatment for COVID-19.  Yet overnight, after returning from a trip to North Carolina where he promoted efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine, Trump retweeted a series of tweets advocating for hydroxychloroquine. One of those tweets included a link to a video that called the drug a "cure" and discounted the need for face masks amid the pandemic. It was later hidden by Twitter as part of their policy to remove misleading information about COVID-19. Twitter also limited access to Donald Trump Jr.'s account for 12 hours for breaking the same rule.  Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, pushed back against Trump during an appearance on ABC's  . "I go along with the FDA," said Fauci. "The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease." During the same interview, Fauci noted that the Miami Marlins'   could endanger the Major League Baseball season altogether, though he doesn't believe they need to stop entirely just yet. With four more positive results on Tuesday, 17 of the team's players and staff members are now confirmed to have the coronavirus. The Marlins were due to play Baltimore on Monday and Tuesday, but Major League Baseball had postponed all Marlins games through Sunday.  "Given the current circumstances, MLB believes that it is most prudent to allow the Marlins time to focus on providing care for their players and planning their Baseball Operations for a resumption early next week," the league said in a statement. At the same time, the Yankees' series against Philadelphia, scheduled for those same days, was also postponed. Elsewhere in sports, the NBA and NHL plan to resume their seasons in bubble environments, with basketball at Lake Buena Vista, Fla., and hockey at Edmonton and Toronto. The NFL has opted not to create a bubble environment as training camps open for the coming season. As of 7:15 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Canada had 114,994 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases. Provinces and territories listed 100,134 of the cases as recovered or resolved. A   based on provincial reports, regional health information and CBC's reporting indicates that 8,946 Canadians have died. On Tuesday, Health Canada approved the drug remdesivir as a  , though Canada's top doctor says the supply is limited. The drug will go by the brand name Veklury and is manufactured by Gilead Sciences Canada. It is now authorized for use in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kilograms.  Ontario Premier Doug Ford says the province has no plans to pull any regions back a step in the province's economic reopening process despite new outbreaks in some areas that have moved into Stage 3. Speaking on Tuesday at a news conference in Ajax, Ont., Ford said the new cases don't amount to a serious surge, adding he will rely on the advice of the province's health-care command table in making any decisions related to the COVID-19 recovery plan. "Right now we have to look at every single region ... but I don't think it's anything that spiked too badly," he said. Two cities in Stage 3 — Ottawa and Sudbury — have reported fresh cases of the coronavirus in recent days. Ottawa reported 25 cases on Tuesday, and Sudbury reported eight on Monday, seven of them in people under 19. The province also announced the construction of a new long-term care home at the Ajax Pickering Hospital, a project it said would add 320 long-term care beds and be completed sometime next year. The project is part of the province's recently announced Accelerated Build Pilot Program, aimed at increasing long-term care capacity, and will be carried out in partnership with Lakeridge Health and Infrastructure Ontario. The total number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario now stands at 38,910, which includes 2,768 deaths and 34,567 resolved cases. For the first time since a public health emergency was declared in B.C. on March 17,  .  Nine people are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, including three in intensive care. There are currently 253 active COVID-19 cases in the province. So far 3,523 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in B.C. and 3,076 people have recovered. The United Nations' humanitarian aid co-ordinator has unlocked another $100 million US from its emergency fund to help 10 under-resourced countries in Africa, the Middle East and the Americas meet pressing needs made worse by the pandemic. The injection from the   brings the total to $225 million US released to help 20 countries this year, a record allocation from its Central Emergency Response Fund. Yemen, which the agency says is facing the world's worst humanitarian crisis, is to receive $35 million, the most of any country. Other top beneficiaries include Afghanistan, Colombia, Mozambique, Nigeria and Pakistan. Meanwhile, virus-linked hunger is leading to the deaths of 10,000 more children a month over the first year of the pandemic, according to an urgent call to action from the UN shared with The Associated Press ahead of its publication in the Lancet medical journal.  Further, more than 550,000 additional children each month are being struck by what is called wasting, according to the UN — malnutrition that manifests in spindly limbs and distended bellies. Over a year, that's up 6.7 million from last year's total of 47 million. Wasting and stunting can permanently damage children physically and mentally, transforming individual tragedies into a generational catastrophe. The International Monetary Fund has approved a $4.3 billion emergency loan to   as it reels under the coronavirus pandemic with the world's fifth-largest virus caseload, and confirmed cases approaching half a million. The fact that Africa's most developed country for the first time approached the IMF for a loan is the latest sign of its pain. Unemployment is above 30 per cent and rising, and major state-owned enterprises were already in poor shape. The Madrid regional government in   is making the wearing of face masks mandatory in all public areas, limiting how many people can gather in one place and targeting young people in a drive to stamp out new outbreaks of the coronavirus. Regional government head Isabel Diaz Ayuso said an information campaign will focus on young people, who are largely blamed for spreading the coronavirus through their social lives. She said young people "have it in their hands to reverse the trend." Madrid, along with Catalonia, is one of Spain's worst-hit regions. It has recorded more than 74,000 cases, with almost 1,900 new infections in the past two weeks. has locked down its third-largest city for two weeks after new cases of coronavirus were found in a hospital.  Vietnam's health ministry reported eight new locally transmitted coronavirus cases linked to three hospitals in the central city of Danang, taking the outbreak to 30 infections since the virus resurfaced. Public transport in and out of Danang was cancelled. Over the weekend, thousands of mostly Vietnamese tourists had to end their summer holidays in the popular beach destination.  Authorities estimated several thousand people would be stranded by the transportation shutdown and asked hotels to shelter them.  The government on Sunday had ordered physical distancing and the closure of nonessential businesses in the city of 1.1 million people.  The head of the  Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, says he has been injected with an experimental coronavirus vaccine in an attempt to persuade the public to follow suit when one is approved. China has positioned itself to be a strong contender in the race for a vaccine. Eight of the nearly two-dozen potential vaccines in various stages of human testing worldwide are from China, the most of any country. The Associated Press reported earlier this month that a state-owned Chinese company injected employees with experimental shots in March, even before the government-approved testing in people — a move that raised ethical concerns among some experts. The capital Beijing also reported its first case of domestic transmission in more than two weeks, while the northeastern province of Liaoning added another six cases in its local outbreak. Another four cases were found among Chinese travellers arriving from outside the country, bringing the daily total over the past 24 hours to 68. In the   capital of Quito, authorities are deploying new sanitary mobile centres to ramp up testing and ease pressure on a health system that is being challenged again by a rapid rise in cases.  Quito has become the country's COVID-19 hotspot, amassing 12,747 cases, which pushed Ecuador's total case count over 82,000, according to figures released by the Health Ministry on Tuesday. The government said Quito is experiencing a "critical situation" as intensive care units have reached full capacity.     Authorities have set up tents in schools across Quito to conduct rapid tests and are providing diagnoses at cultural   centres and a basketball stadium. Medical brigades are also being dispatched by the Health Ministry to patrol neighbourhoods with high rates of infection and conduct spot tests. officials have sent an emergency medical team, usually deployed to disaster zones, to aged care homes in Melbourne to try help contain a rapidly spreading outbreak. Another hotspot, in inner-city Sydney, has forced a senior adviser to Prime Minister Scott Morrison into self-isolation. Australia has so far reported relatively fewer coronavirus cases than many other countries, but a spike in community transmission in the southeast states of Victoria and New South Wales has alarmed health officials. Australia has recorded just over 15,300 cases and 167 deaths as of Tuesday.  With files from CBC News and Reuters Add some “good” to your morning and evening.

Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited   published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.

The two issues are linked, but during the coronavirus pandemic the relationship is not always simple. Pooled testing, which can make one coronavirus test as powerful as five, is particularly useful when the infection rate is low. Its use could free up more tests for places where the virus is more widespread. The coronavirus pandemic has left ordinary people debating case counts, positivity rates and hospitalization numbers in hopes of understanding the virus’s path.

A surge of   cases in Hutterite colonies on the Prairies has led to people from those communities facing discrimination and being turned away by local businesses, which health officials say has made the already challenging task of responding to those outbreaks more difficult. As the number of cases climb in Western Canada, Hutterite colonies that stretch across Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are reporting   from nearby towns. The provinces are working with Hutterite leadership to curb the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but an inconsistent approach about how much to say about the outbreaks – or whether to link them to Hutterites at all – has left some communities feeling exposed. “There are concerns about the fact that the name Hutterite has been used when putting out reports,” said Mark Waldner, a Hutterian Safety Council representative for Manitoba. Story continues below advertisement “But the point is that we’re doing our part to prevent the spread. From what I’ve seen, there has been a greater response in colonies.” A   at Hutterite colonies since early June led to concern that infections were connected to a funeral at Spring Valley Hutterite Colony in Alberta for three teenage cousins who went missing after a boating accident. The funeral drew visitors from neighbouring colonies in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Provincial health authorities have alluded to interprovincial travel as a potential source of the spread in Hutterite communities, but have also said there is no link to the funeral. On Monday, Saskatchewan identified   in Hutterite colonies in the province and warned of potentially hundreds more infections among people who are awaiting test results. The Hutterian Safety Council, which includes spiritual leaders, educators, volunteer firefighters, safety instructors and first medical responders, said that public-health authorities have provided guidelines for physical distancing and contact tracing that address the challenges in their communities, but mixed messages on virus spread across provincial borders have caused some uncertainty. “I’ve been receiving confusing messages, even from our government,” Mr. Waldner said. “Our thoughts were that there was no link to the funeral, but it sometimes seems as if the provinces are saying otherwise, so I’m not sure. But I don’t think there’s a direct link.” Hutterites live and work communally on the Prairies and in some northern regions of the United States. There are 370 Hutterite colonies in Canada with a total population of 35,010, according to the 2016 census. Hutterites, who share Protestant Anabaptist roots with Mennonites and Amish people, are recognized by their traditional clothing, small-scale farming and manufacturing, and isolation from surrounding society. Story continues below advertisement Hutterites follow traditions such as communal dining and worship, which make them vulnerable to outbreaks and complicate physical-distancing requirements, according to Mark Loeb, an infectious-disease professor at McMaster University in Hamilton. The researcher previously worked with Hutterite communities to study flu immunization and is leading a federally funded study that will collaborate with colonies to examine herd immunity to COVID-19. “Many of the key activities are communal,” Dr. Loeb said. “The adults and children will eat together and the women work together in the kitchen. It’s a very close-knit society and it functions very well as a unit, so when there’s an outbreak it’s hard to break up those pieces.” Of the 120 Hutterite colonies in Manitoba, five have active cases, according to the Hutterian Safety Council. More than 20 colonies have restricted non-essential travel, and some without any cases have chosen to voluntarily lock down their communities as a precautionary measure. Meanwhile, their members have faced stigmatization from surrounding towns, including “being refused at physical and massage therapy clinics, retail outlets, and also experiencing unwarranted cultural profiling at medical and dental offices,” according to a statement from the Hutterian council. Hutterite leaders said when authorities announce cases at colonies, it causes unnecessary fear in nearby communities, leading to discrimination.     In a letter to the Manitoba government last week, a Hutterite minister told the province to stop stating when COVID-19 outbreaks happen in colonies, arguing it leads to stigmatization. Paul Waldner, who is from the CanAm Hutterite Colony in southwest Manitoba, said in the letter that if the province refused, the colony would file a human-rights complaint. Story continues below advertisement The following day, Chief Provincial Public Health Officer Brent Roussin said Manitoba will no longer indicate when new cases are in Hutterite communities unless it involves a risk to public health. “At first, we saw a lot of stigma against Asian-Canadians,” Dr. Roussin said last week. “Now, we see stigma against Hutterites for this. And it’s not useful, it’s not appropriate, and it actually hinders public health’s ability to control this virus.” In Saskatchewan, the government discloses cases in Hutterite colonies and identifies the regions where the outbreaks are located. The province reported a spike in cases on Monday, with 22 of the 31 new cases in colonies. While cases across Saskatchewan have risen from five or fewer cases per day to five to 10, Hutterite colonies have seen as many as 20 cases per day, said Saskatchewan Chief Medical Health Officer Saqib Shahab. Public-health officials have approached 300 to 400 Hutterite community members that they suspect may test positive and they expect an infection rate of 4 to 6 per cent across colonies, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said on Monday. “This is a severe outbreak,” he said. “That’s a tremendously high infection rate. It’s something that we’re taking very seriously.” Story continues below advertisement He added the province may impose stricter limitations, such as banning travel between colonies and towns, but that people should not stigmatize Hutterites as they work to curb spread in their communities. “I would ask all Saskatchewan residents to treat one another, whether you’re from a Hutterite colony or not, with the exactly the same respect that you expect to be treated with in return,” said Mr. Moe. Public-health officials will visit each colony in the province to provide physical-distancing guidelines and testing while Hutterite colonies are placing signs on gates notifying visitors that they cannot enter. They are asking truck drivers picking up products for farmers markets to remain in the vehicle and restricting members from visiting other towns and colonies. Saskatchewan health officials said in June that physical distancing and testing had been met with resistance by some people in Hutterite colonies in the early stages of the pandemic. While some Hutterite communities initially believed they would be insulated from the virus and did not need to take precautions, that sentiment has changed since cases spiked and the Hutterian council started communicating preventative measures, said David Tschetter, a council representative focused on Alberta and Saskatchewan. But even as colonies have started taking measures to curb the spread, he said that local businesses have continued barring Hutterites. “All people in society, Hutterite and non-Hutterite, have a moral obligation to respect one another,” said Mr. Tschetter. “The greater responsibility is doing your part to ensure you’re not spreading the virus. If our Hutterite members have in any way acted inappropriately, then does that justify discrimination against an entire culture? Well, the obvious answer is no.” Story continues below advertisement While Alberta does not specify when outbreaks are in colonies, some local governments have had to tell residents to stop stigmatizing neighbouring Hutterite communities. A joint statement on July 16 by the Town of Claresholm, the Municipal District of Willow Creek and Livingstone-Macleod MLA Roger Reid said they received several reports of discrimination against Hutterite members after COVID-19 cases spiked. Members of the community are easily identifiable and when provinces disclose cases in Hutterite colonies, it is similar to naming families or homes in a neighbourhood, said Dr. Loeb, the McMaster professor. “It’s like people publicly identifying where someone lives in their home and saying that that person has COVID,” he said. “Making this public is awful and it violates confidentiality.” Welcome to The Globe and Mail’s comment community.

COVID-19 is a novel (new) coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, China in late 2019. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that originate in animals, but are known to cause respiratory illness in humans, particularly during the fall and winter months. Other novel coronaviruses include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). The World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Public Health Ontario has conducted laboratory testing and collaborated with healthcare partners to expand testing capacity since the outset of COVID-19. We are also working very closely with the Ministry of Health and local public health units to provide evidence and expertise that will inform decisions and policy around surveillance, case and contact management, and infection control.

	The U.S. could “virtually eliminate” the coronavirus in a “matter of weeks” if the country enacts several strict measures to bring down the number of new cases, according to a former health official under the Obama administration. 
	Andy Slavitt, the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) during much of former president Barack Obama’s second term, said it’s possible for the U.S. to return to a “reasonably normal” existence, if “we want to.” 
  on Sunday, Slavitt laid out how the country could completely reopen in October, if they “threw the kitchen sink at COVID-19” right away. 
 ” comprises six major points of action that would need to be implemented right away: 
	While he acknowledged it would be a “tough few weeks,” Slavitt said Americans would still be able to be outside, enjoy nature, and gather safely with friends. 
	“Our grandparents who lived through a decade long depression, a 6 year world war, or whatever hardship they faced in their country would tell us we would make it,”  . 
	After the lockdown measures have been lifted, Slavitt didn’t promise the virus would be completely gone, but he said testing and contact tracing would be much more manageable. 
	“While we do this, what else happens? Well our nurses & doctors can catch their breath, recover & go back to healing our other issues. We hug our parents again. Our scientists can work on vaccines they can get right & safe. They can be speedy without rushing,” he said. 
	Slavitt said people will still have to take precautions, such as wearing masks in larger settings and elevators, but the sacrifice will be worth it if they can get the outbreak under control. 
	“We will do this. There is no other way. The question is when. The question is who will convince us. The question is the leadership it takes. But there’s not much question if we should,”  .  
			We can be back to a reasonably normal existence: schools, travel, job growth, safer nursing homes & other settings. 
 
			And we could do it in a matter of weeks. If we want to. 2/ Pedestrians wear masks as they walk in front of a sign reminding the public to take steps to stop the spread of coronavirus, July 23, 2020, in Glendale, Calif.

     There are three parameters to understand in order to assess the magnitude of the risk posed by this novel coronavirus:  The   or   (how rapidly the disease spreads) of a virus is indicated by its reproductive number (Ro, pronounced   or  ), which represents the average number of people to which a single infected person will transmit the virus. WHO's estimated (on Jan. 23) Ro to be between 1.4 and 2.5.  Other studies have estimated a Ro between 3.6 and 4.0, and between 2.24 to 3.58.  .  Preliminary studies had estimated Ro to be between    An outbreak with a reproductive number of below 1 will gradually disappear. For comparison, the Ro for the common flu is 1.3 and for SARS it was 2.0. The novel coronavirus' case   has been estimated at around  , in the WHO press conference held on January 29, 2020   . However, it noted that, without knowing how many were infected, it was too early to be able to put a percentage on the mortality rate figure.  A prior estimate   had put that number at 3%.  Fatality rate can change as a virus can mutate, according to epidemiologists. For comparison, the case fatality rate for SARS was 10%, and for MERS 34%. Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 (estimated ranges vary from 2-10 days, 2-14 days, and 10-14 days,  ), during which the virus is contagious but the patient does not display any symptom ( ). According to early estimates by China's National Health Commission (NHC), about 80% of those who died were over the age of 60 and 75% of them had
pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and
diabetes. According to the   issued on Jan. 27:
 A study of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP found that the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men.   The WHO, in its  , addresses the question:  by answering that:  
As of Jan. 29, according to French authorities, the conditions of the two earliest Paris cases had worsened and the patients were being treated in intensive care, according to French authorities. The patients have been described as a young couple aged  , both Chinese citizens from Wuhan who were asymptomatic when they arrived in Paris on January 18  .  The NHC reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm on January 22, 2020. The deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median age of the deaths was 75 (range 48-89) years. On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a Global Public Health Emergency. For more information from the WHO regarding novel coronavirus:
