 The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. We are providing a taxable benefit of $2,000 every 4 weeks for up to 24 weeks to eligible workers who have stopped working or whose work hours have been reduced due to COVID-19. An online questionnaire will help us direct you to the service option that best fits your situation (i.e. eligibility for Employment Insurance benefits or not).  You can also look for employment opportunities through the  An extra $300 per child was delivered through the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) for 2019-20. This benefit was delivered as part of the scheduled CCB payment on May 20.       The payment due date for current year individual, corporate, and trust income tax returns, including instalment payments has been extended to September 30, 2020. Penalties and interest will not be charged if payments are made by this date. Homeowners facing financial hardship may be eligible for a mortgage payment deferral of up to six months. The deferral is an agreement between you and your lender. Typically, the agreement indicates that you and your lender have agreed to pause or suspend your mortgage payments for a certain amount of time.  After the agreement ends, your mortgage payments return to normal and the deferred payments — including principal and accumulated interest – are added to the outstanding principal balance and subsequently repaid throughout the life of the mortgage. To know if you are eligible for a mortgage payment deferral or to learn what options are available, contact your lender — your bank or your mortgage professional. All provinces and territories have confirmed, or are in the process of confirming, plans to provide wage top-ups for essential workers.  We will provide  up to $3 billion in federal support to increase the wages of low-income  essential workers. Each province or territory will determine which workers  would be eligible for support, and how much support they will receive. We  provided  a one-time special payment  through the   for low and modest-income  families. The  average additional benefit will be close to $400 for single individuals and  close to $600 for couples.    We are providing a one-time, tax-free, non-reportable payment of $600 to help Canadians with disabilities who are recipients of any of the following programs or benefits: Seniors who are eligible for the one-time payment for persons with disabilities would receive a total of $600 in special payments. The one-time payment to persons with disabilities would be adjusted to provide a top-up for eligible seniors, including: We are providing a taxable benefit of  $1,250 every 4 weeks to eligible students or $2,000 to eligible students with  dependents or with disability who are not eligible for the Canada Emergency  Response Benefit or Employment Insurance or unable to work due to COVID-19.  This benefit is  available from May to August 2020.  You can also look for employment opportunities through the  We made changes to the Canada Student Loans Program (CSLP) to allow more students to qualify for  support and be eligible for greater amounts. The changes  include: All student loan borrowers will automatically have their loan repayments and interest suspended until September 30, 2020.   We are providing additional support to student researchers and post-doctoral fellows through the federal granting councils. Funding will support a one-semester extension for eligible students  whose research scholarships or fellowships end between March and  August 2020 and who intend to continue their studies. It will also provide a 3-month  extension in funding for holders of federal research grants to support eligible  trainees and staff paid out of these awards.  We have removed the restriction that allows international  students to work only a maximum of 20 hours per week while classes are in  session, provided they are working in an essential service or function, such as  health care, critical infrastructure, or the supply of food or other critical goods. This temporary rule change will be in place until August 31,  2020. We are providing  a one-time tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for the Old Age  Security (OAS) pension, with an additional $200 for seniors eligible for the  Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).   This measure  would give a total of $500 to individuals who are eligible to receive both the  OAS and the GIS, and will help them cover increased costs caused by COVID-19.   . This payment will  be issued during the week of July 6. We are temporarily extending GIS and Allowance payments if seniors’ 2019       income information has not been assessed. This  will ensure that the most vulnerable seniors continue to receive their benefits  when they need them the most. To avoid an interruption in benefits, seniors are  encouraged to submit their 2019 income information as soon as possible and no  later than by October 1, 2020. We reduced the required minimum withdrawals from Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) by 25 % for 2020.   We are providing $380 million for a new distinctions-based Indigenous Community Support Fund to address immediate needs in First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation communities. These funds could be used for measures including, but not limited to: We are providing $100 million to support a range of federal health measures, including support for preparedness in First Nation and Inuit communities. We are providing an additional $25 million to Nutrition North Canada to increase subsidies so families can afford much-needed personal hygiene products and nutritious food. We are providing $75.2 million to offer  additional distinctions-based support to First Nations, Inuit and Métis Nation  post-secondary students We are providing $285.1 million to fund community-led  responses to the pandemic and provide targeted increases in primary health care  resources for First Nations communities. In case of outbreaks, this funding can be used to provide  surge capacity and additional support for community-based services in First  Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities. We are providing $270 million to supplement the On-Reserve  Income Assistance Program to address increased demand on the program, which  will help individuals and families meet their essential living expenses. It  will also help hire additional staff to better serve First Nations communities  and connect individuals to other government programs. First Nations administer the On-Reserve Income Assistance  Program. Program staff members play an important role in helping individuals  with other needs, including providing referrals to mental health and addictions  counselling, and helping families find and apply for appropriate government  benefits, such as Employment Insurance, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit,  and the Canada Child Benefit. We are providing $44.8 million over five years to build 12  new shelters, which will help protect and support Indigenous women and girls  experiencing and fleeing violence.  This funding will help build 10 shelters in First Nations  communities on reserve across the country (funded through Canada Mortgage and  Housing Corporation’s Shelter Enhancement Program) and two in the territories  (funded through National Housing Co-Investment Fund), to support Indigenous  women and children. We will also provide $40.8 million to support operational  costs for these new shelters over the first five years, and $10.2 million  annually ongoing. We are also announcing $1 million a year ongoing, starting  this year, to support engagement with Métis leaders and service providers on  shelter provision and community-led violence prevention projects for Métis  women, girls, and LGBTQ and two-spirit people. The process to access the funding for the shelters will be  through an Expression of Interest. First Nations on reserve across the country  and Indigenous governments and/or organizations in the territories will be  eligible to submit proposals. Indigenous peoples can also access  all other benefits.  We are covering a portion of an employee's wages for eligible employers. The  CEWS will allow you to re-hire your employees and avoid layoffs as the economy  continues to safely reopen.   The Temporary 10% Wage Subsidy is a three-month measure that allows eligible employers to reduce the amount of payroll deductions required to be remitted to the Canada Revenue Agency.    We have extended the maximum duration of the   from 38 weeks to 76 weeks for employers affected by COVID-19. This measure will provide income support to employees eligible for Employment Insurance who agree to reduce their normal working hours because of developments beyond the control of their employers. We are creating up to 116,000 jobs, placements, and other  training opportunities to help students find employment and develop valuable  skills this summer and over the coming months.  We also made temporary changes to the Canada  Summer Jobs program to allow employers to: Learn more about the various programs: We have extended time periods for temporary layoffs by up to six months in the Canada Labour Standards Regulations to allow employers more time to recall laid-off employees. The temporary changes will help protect the jobs of federally regulated private-sector employees and support employers facing economic hardship as a result of the pandemic. We are allowing all businesses to defer, until after August 31, 2020, the payment of any income tax amounts that become owing on or after March 18 and before September 2020. This relief would apply to tax balances due, as well as instalments, under Part I of the  .  No interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this  period.  We are allowing businesses, including self-employed individuals, to defer until June 30, 2020 payments of the GST/HST, as well as customs duty owing on their imports. Any GST/HST payment that becomes owing from March 27 until the end of May can be deferred until the end of June.  For GST and customs duty payments for imported goods, deferral will include amounts owing for March, April and May. These amounts were normally due to be submitted to the Canada Revenue Agency and the Canada Border Services Agency as early as the end of March 2020. We are waiving tariffs on certain medical goods, including  PPE such as masks and gloves.  This will reduce the cost of imported PPE for Canadians,  help protect workers, and ensure our supply chains can keep functioning well. The Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) provides interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to small businesses and  not-for-profits, to help cover their operating costs during a period where  their revenues have been temporarily reduced. This program has been implemented  by banks and credit unions in collaboration with Export Development Canada. Business owners can apply for support from CEBA through their   and  . Through the Business Credit Availability Program, Export Development Canada (EDC) is working with financial institutions to guarantee 80% of new operating credit and cash flow term loans of up to $6.25 million to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This financing support is to be used for operational expenses and is available to both exporting and non-exporting companies. Through the Business Credit Availability Program, Business Development Canada (BDC) is working with financial institutions to co-lend term loans of up to $6.25 million to SMEs for their operational cash flow requirements. The program offers differing maximum finance amounts based on business revenues. This support is available until or before September 30, 2020. 
 We are providing nearly $962 million through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF) to help more businesses and organizations in sectors such as manufacturing, technology, tourism and others that are key to the regions and to local economies. This fund is specifically targeted to those that may require additional help to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, but have been unable to access other support measures. Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) provides relief for small businesses experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19. Over the course of the program, property owners will reduce rent by at least 75 % for the months of April, May, June, and July for their small business tenants. CECRA will cover 50 % of the rent, with the tenant paying up to 25 % and the property owner forgiving at least 25 %.  Through the Business Credit Availability Program, the Business Development Canada’s (BDC) Mid-Market Financing Program will provide commercial loans ranging between  $12.5 million and $60 million to medium-sized businesses whose credit needs  exceed what is already available through the Business Credit Availability  Program and other measures.  BDC  anticipates that qualifying companies will have annual revenues in excess of  approximately $100 million. Through the Business Credit Availability Program, EDC’s Mid-Market Guarantee and Financing Program will bring liquidity to companies who tend to have  revenues of between $50 million to $300 million, to sustain operations during  this uncertain period. EDC will continue to work with Canadian financial  institutions to guarantee 75 % of new operating credit and cash-flow  loans – ranging in size from $16.75 million to a maximum of $80 million. These expanded guarantees are available to exporters, international investors and  businesses that sell their products or services within Canada.  More  details will be made available soon. We are making available $15 million in non-repayable support for businesses in the territories to help address the impacts of COVID-19. This support will assist businesses with operating costs not already covered by other Government of Canada measures. The Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF) provides bridge financing to Canada’s largest employers, whose needs during the  pandemic are not being met through conventional financing, in order to keep  their operations going. The additional liquidity provided through LEEFF allows Canada’s largest  businesses, their workers and their suppliers to remain active during this  difficult time, and position them for a rapid economic recovery.  This program is delivered by the Canada Development Investment Corporation,  in cooperation with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada and the  Department of Finance.       We are investing $250 million to assist innovative, early-stage companies that are unable to access other COVID-19 business supports through the Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP). IRAP provides advice, connections, and funding to help Canadian small and medium-sized businesses increase their innovation capacity and take ideas to market. We are providing $20.1 million in support for Futurpreneur Canada to continue supporting young entrepreneurs across Canada who are facing challenges due to COVID-19. The funding will allow Futurpreneur Canada to provide payment relief for its clients for up to 12 months. We are  providing $15 million  in new funding through the   (WES). This funding will be available to existing WES  Ecosystem Fund recipient organizations, enabling  these third-party organizations to provide timely support and advice to women  entrepreneurs facing hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are providing a taxable benefit of $2,000 every 4 weeks for up to 24 weeks to eligible workers who have stopped working or whose work hours have been reduced due to COVID-19.

This relief would apply to tax balances due, as well as instalments, under Part I of the  .  No interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this  period.  We are providing $306.8 million in funding to help small and medium-sized Indigenous  businesses, and to support Aboriginal Financial Institutions that offer  financing to these businesses. The funding  will allow for short-term, interest-free loans and non-repayable contributions  through Aboriginal Financial Institutions, which offer financing and business  support services to First Nations, Inuit, and Métis businesses.  Financial support for Indigenous businesses will be provided through Aboriginal Financial Institutions, and administered by the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association and the Métis capital corporations in partnership with Indigenous Services Canada. We announced $133  million in new funding to support Indigenous business through the pandemic and  into recovery. Of these additional funds, $117 million will reach more community-owned  First Nation, Inuit and Métis businesses including microbusinesses, who are not  eligible for existing business support measures.  Indigenous  communities rely on these businesses to provide revenue for important services,  and to create meaningful jobs.  We announced a  new stimulus development fund that will provide $16 million to support the  Indigenous tourism industry. The Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada will  administer the fund to businesses across the country that have lost revenue due  to COVID-19. Indigenous peoples can also access  all other benefits. We are providing immediate, temporary  relief to sponsors of federally regulated, defined benefit pension plans in the  form of a moratorium, through the remainder of 2020, on solvency payment  requirements for defined benefit plans.  This  relief will help ensure that employers have the financial resources they need  to maintain their operations and their pension plans, and to protect the  retirement security of their workers and retirees.  We launched an  , in which we will  purchase up to $150 billion of insured mortgage pools through the Canada  Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  This action will provide  long-term stable funding to banks and mortgage lenders, help facilitate  continued lending to Canadian consumers and businesses, and add liquidity to  Canada's mortgage market.   The Bank of Canada is acting in several ways to support the economy and financial system and stands ready to take any and all actions that it can to protect the well-being of Canadians during this difficult time. The Bank has responded by lowering interest rates, intervening to support key financial markets and providing liquidity support for financial institutions.    The  Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions announced it is   of risk-weighted assets. This  action will allow Canada's large banks to inject $300 billion of additional  lending in to the economy. We are  providing $50 million to help farmers, fish harvesters, and all food production  and processing employers, put in place the measures necessary to follow the  mandatory 14-day isolation period required of all workers arriving from abroad.  The Mandatory Isolation Support for Temporary  Foreign Workers Program (MISTFWP) provides support of $1,500 for each temporary foreign worker, to employers  or those working with them to ensure requirements are fully met. The funding is  conditional on employers not being found in violation of the mandatory  isolation.  We have enabled Farm Credit Canada to provide an additional $5 billion in lending to producers, agribusinesses, and food processors. This will offer increased flexibility to farmers who face cashflow issues and to processors who are impacted by lost sales, helping them remain financially sound during this difficult time.

                     We launched a $77.5 million Emergency Processing Fund to help food producers access more personal protective equipment, adapt to health protocols, automate or modernize their facilities, processes, and operations, and respond to emerging pressures from COVID-19.   We are launching a national AgriRecovery initiative of up to $125 million in funding to help producers faced with additional costs incurred by COVID-19 such as set-asides for cattle and hog management programs to manage livestock backed-up on farms, due to the temporary closure of food processing plants. This new federal funding will help beef and pork producers and processors adapt to a changing market, and help farmers and ranchers keep their animals longer before marketing. We have increased the Canadian Dairy Commission’s borrowing limit by $200 million to support costs associated with the temporary storage of cheese and butter to avoid food waste. We launched the Surplus Food Purchase Program with an initial $50 million fund designed to help redistribute existing and unsold inventories, which could include products such as potatoes and poultry, to local food organizations who are serving vulnerable Canadians. We are working with provinces and territories to increase interim payments from 50 % to 75 % through AgriStability, a federal, provincial and territorial program that supports producers who face significant revenue declines. This change has already been enacted in some provinces.    We are working with provinces and  territories to explore possibilities for expanding the AgriInsurance program to  include labour shortages as an eligible risk for the horticulture sector. This  work would insure against lost production due to an insufficient workforce,  should producers be unable to find enough labour to harvest.   We are  providing $50 million to help farmers, fish harvesters, and all food production  and processing employers, put in place the measures necessary to follow the  mandatory 14-day isolation period required of all workers arriving from abroad.  The Mandatory Isolation Support for Temporary  Foreign Workers Program (MISTFWP) provides support of $1,500 for each temporary foreign worker, to employers  or those working with them to ensure requirements are fully met. The funding is  conditional on employers not being found in violation of the mandatory  isolation.  We have enabled Farm Credit Canada to provide an additional $5 billion in lending to producers, agribusinesses, and food processors. This will offer increased flexibility to farmers who face cashflow issues and to processors who are impacted by lost sales, helping them remain financially sound during this difficult time.   We are providing $62.5 million of new assistance to the fish and seafood processing sector through the Canadian Seafood Stabilization Fund. This will help businesses: Regional Development Agencies are  now accepting applications to the Fund.  We are launching the Fish  Harvester Benefit,  to provide income  support for this year’s fishing seasons to eligible self-employed fish  harvesters and sharespersons crew who cannot access the Canada Emergency Wage  Subsidy.  This support will be provided  to those that experience fishing income declines of greater than 25% in the  2020 tax year, compared with a reference period to be identified. This measure covers 75% of fishing  income losses beyond a 25% income decline threshold, up to a maximum individual  entitlement equivalent to what is provided under the Canada Emergency Wage  Subsidy ($847 per week for up to 12 weeks).  More details will be available  soon. We are launching the Fish  Harvester Grant, to provide grants to fish  harvesters impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and who are ineligible for the  Canada Emergency Business Account or equivalent measures.  This will provide more  liquidity to address non-deferrable business costs. The program would provide  non-repayable support of up to $10,000 to self-employed fish harvesters with a  valid fishing licence. Size of the non-repayable support will vary depending on  the level of fish harvesters’ historic revenue. More details will be available  soon. We are proposing measures or  changes to Employment Insurance (EI) that would allow self-employed fish  harvesters and sharespersons to access EI benefits on the basis of insurable  earnings from previous seasons (winter and summer claims). More details will be available  soon.  We have  established a $500 million Emergency Support Fund  as a temporary relief measure to help  alleviate the financial pressures of cultural, heritage and sport organizations  facing significant losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We are investing $25.7 million to help Canada’s six national museums and the National Battlefields Commission. This investment will help these institutions to maintain essential services and be ready to reopen their doors to the public once precautionary measures are lifted. It will also protect jobs on which many Canadians depend.  We have made an emergency investment of $18.2 million to help the National Arts Centre ensure the continuity of its operations and be ready to reopen to the public.  The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will not issue letters requesting payment for Part I licence fees by private broadcasters for the 2020–21 fiscal year. We are providing the CRTC with the necessary funds to support its operations, in the absence of these fees.  We are providing up to $17.3 million to the governments of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut to support critical air services to Northern and remote communities, in partnership with investments by the territorial governments, to ensure the continued supply of food, medical supplies, and other essential goods and services to remote and fly-in communities. We are waiving ground lease rents from March 2020 through to December 2020 for the 21 airport authorities that pay rent to the federal government. We are also providing comparable treatment for PortsToronto, which operates Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and pays a charge to the federal government. We will work with tourism  operators in national parks, historic sites, and marine conservation areas to  defer payments on commercial leases and licences of occupation without interest  until September 1, 2020. In addition, we will waive up to 75 percent of eligible commercial rents for the months of April, May and June 2020 or equivalent amounts of annual rents. We are providing up to $1.72 billion to the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia, and to the Alberta Orphan Well Association, to clean up orphan and inactive oil and gas wells. This will help maintain approximately 5,200 jobs in Alberta alone. We are providing up to $750 million to create a new Emissions Reduction Fund to support workers and reduce emissions in Canada's oil and gas sector, with a focus on methane. This fund will provide primarily repayable contributions to conventional and offshore oil and gas firms to support their investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Of this amount, $75 million will be allocated to the offshore sector.  We are providing wage support for up to 75% of wages for individuals working in universities and health institutes, for a maximum of $847 per week per employee. This will ensure that universities and health research institutes can retain research staff. We are covering up to 75% of total eligible costs for research activities, and will support activities such as the safe storage of dangerous substances, and restarting data sets that were interrupted during the pandemic. This will ensure that universities and health research institutes maintain essential research activities and return to full research operations once back to normal. We are accelerating $2.2  billion in annual federal infrastructure funding for communities through the  Gas Tax Fund. The funding will be delivered in one payment in June will help  communities quickly move forward with infrastructure projects that will improve  our quality of life and help restart local economies.   Communities have  flexibility to use the funding to meet their local needs. Projects could  include access to high-speed broadband, improvements to water and road systems,  and the building of cycling and walking paths.  We are proposing to protect jobs and safe operations of junior mining exploration and other flow-through share issuers, by extending the timelines for spending the capital they raise via flow-through shares by 12 months. With the impacts of COVID-19 on operations, this would mean that companies would be allowed additional time to incur eligible expenses, allowing them to safely plan when to best continue operations, while allowing them to avoid costs from not meeting original flow-through share timelines. This initiative would protect the good, well-paying jobs that many Canadians depend on, including those in rural, remote, northern and Indigenous communities. We invested $350 million to support  vulnerable Canadians through charities and non-profit organizations that  deliver essential services to those in need. We are providing $100 million to national, regional, and local organizations across Canada to: We are contributing $9 million through United Way Canada for local organizations to support practical services to Canadian seniors. These services could include the delivery of groceries, medications, or other needed items, or personal outreach to assess individuals' needs and connect them to community supports.  We are expanding the  New Horizons for Seniors Program with an additional investment of $20 million  to support organizations that offer community-based projects that reduce  isolation, improve the quality of life of seniors, and help them maintain a  social support network.  For all organizations  who received funding under the 2019-2020 New Horizons for Seniors Program  community-based stream, funding can be used to provide immediate and essential  services to seniors impacted by COVID-19. We are continuing to support people experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 outbreak by providing $157.5 million to the Reaching Home initiative. The funding can be used by recipients for a range of needs such as purchasing beds and physical barriers for social distancing and securing accommodation to reduce overcrowding in shelters. We provided support to women's shelters and sexual assault centres, including facilities in Indigenous communities, to help manage and prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in their facilities. Over 500 organizations across Canada received support to protect some of Canada’s most vulnerable. We are giving $7.5 million in funding to Kids Help Phone to provide young people with the mental health support they need during this difficult time. We are providing $100 million to the Canadian Red Cross to enhance their response capacity and to support public health efforts. With this funding, the Red Cross will: A new investment of $15 million in 2020-21 will provide community  organizations with resources to improve workplace accessibility and access to  jobs in response to COVID-19, including by helping employers set up accessible  and effective work-from-home arrangements. This support will also cover  expanding accessible online training opportunities and helping connect  Canadians with disabilities working from home with employers.  We  are investing $1.18 million in five new projects across the country through the  Accessible Technology Program. With this funding, organizations will develop  dynamic and affordable technology, such as accessible payment terminals for  retailers and tools to make communication easier for Canadians with  disabilities in the digital economy.

The experts will develop the scope and TOR for a WHO-led international mission.  29 June 2020 WHO published an updated and detailed timeline of WHO’s response to the pandemic on our website, so the public can have a look at what happened in the past six months in relation to the response.  It illustrates the range of WHO’s work to stop transmission and save lives.  17 June 2020 WHO announced that the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) arm of the Solidarity Trial to find an effective COVID-19 treatment was being stopped.  The trial's Executive Group and principal investigators made the decision based on evidence from the Solidarity trial, UK's Recovery trial and a Cochrane review of other evidence on hydroxychloroquine.  Data from Solidarity (including the French Discovery trial data) and the recently announced results from the UK's Recovery trial both showed that hydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care.  Investigators will not randomize further patients to hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trial. Patients who have already started hydroxychloroquine but who have not yet finished their course in the trial may complete their course or stop at the discretion of the supervising physician.  This decision applies only to the conduct of the Solidarity trial and does not apply to the use or evaluation of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19. 16 June 2020 WHO welcomes the initial clinical trial results from the UK that show dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, can be lifesaving for patients who are critically ill with COVID-19. For patients on ventilators, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by about
    one third, and for patients requiring only oxygen, mortality was cut by about one fifth, according to preliminary findings shared with WHO.    We   welcome results from a large RCT, that dexamethasone reduces mortality among the most severe   patients. Focus must be on saving lives and preventing new infections Coronavirus breakthrough: dexamethasone is first drug shown to save lives          13 June 2020 WHO followed up with Chinese authorities about a cluster of COVID-19 cases in Beijing, People’s Republic of China. Officials from the National Health Commission and Beijing Health Commission briefed WHO’s China country office, to share details of preliminary investigations ongoing in Beijing.   WHO offered support and technical assistance, as well as requested further information about the cluster and the investigations underway and planned.   "Last week,   reported a new cluster of   cases in Beijing, after more than 50 days without a case in that city. More than 100 cases have now been confirmed. The origin and extent of the outbreak are being investigated"-       11 June 2020 The pandemic is accelerating in Africa – it took 98 days to reach 100 000 cases and only 18 days to move to 200 000 cases. Ten out of 54 countries are currently driving the rise in numbers, accounting for nearly 80% of all the cases. More than 70% of the deaths are taking place in only five countries: Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa and Sudan. WHO and other partners have supported governments with scaling up health workforce and laboratory capacities and to set up points-of-entry screening at airports and border crossings. These public health and social measures have been effective in slowing
        the spread of COVID-19 in Africa.   More than 200,000   cases have been confirmed on the African continent, with over 5,600 deaths. While   accounts for a small fraction of the global caseload, case numbers are growing at an accelerating pace. Read more:        7 June 2020  3 June 2020 Having met on 23 May 2020, the Executive Group of the Solidarity Trial decided to implement a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial, because of concerns raised about the safety of the drug. This decision was taken as a precaution while the safety data were reviewed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee of the Solidarity Trial.  On 3 June 2020, on the basis of the available mortality data, the members of the committee have recommended that there are no reasons to modify the trial protocol. The Executive Group received this recommendation and endorsed the continuation of all arms of the Solidarity Trial, including hydroxychloroquine. The Data Safety and Monitoring Committee will continue to closely monitor the safety of all therapeutics being tested in the Solidarity Trial.   1 June 2020  WHO has released a May 2020 survey, which charts the impact of COVID-19 on prevention and treatment services for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), since the pandemic began.  More than half (53%) of the countries surveyed have partially or completely disrupted services for hypertension treatment; 49% for treatment for diabetes and diabetes-related complications; 42% for cancer treatment, and 31% for cardiovascular emergencies.  Rehabilitation services have been disrupted in almost two-thirds (63%) of countries, even though rehabilitation is key to a healthy recovery following severe illness from COVID-19. In the majority (94%) of countries responding, ministry of health staff working in the area of NCDs were partially or fully reassigned to support COVID-19. Among the countries reporting service disruptions, globally 58% of countries are now using telemedicine (advice by telephone or online means) to replace in-person consultations; in low-income countries this figure is 42%.   Recent WHO survey shows disruption due to   for  ❗️hypertension treatment, ❗️treatment for diabetes, ❗️cancer treatment, ❗️cardiovascular emergencies & ❗️rehabilitation 👉            1 June 2020 This guidance recommends practical actions that countries can take at national, subregional and local levels to reorganize and safely maintain access to high-quality, essential health services in the pandemic context.  It also outlines sample indicators for monitoring essential health services, and describes considerations on when to stop and restart services as COVID-19 transmission recedes and surges.    "Building on previous guidance on maintaining essential health services through the   pandemic, today we are providing operational guidance on how best to put that into practice"-       1 June 2020 Aimed at those on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response – from food store staff to employers to emergency responders – WHO has released illustrated advice for taking care of one’s own mental well-being, communicating with empathy,

        accessible to all. C-TAP will be voluntary and based on social solidarity. It will provide a one-stop shop for scientific knowledge, data and intellectual property to be shared equitably by the global community.  WHO, Costa Rica and all the co-sponsor countries have also issued a “Solidarity Call to Action” asking relevant stakeholders to join and support the initiative, with recommended actions for key groups, such as governments, research and
        development funders, researchers, industry and civil society.    30 countries & multiple international partners and institutions have signed up to support the   Technology Access Pool in a bid to make vaccines, tests, treatments and other health technologies to fight COVID-19 accessible to all. 👉🏽     The Director-General and Costa Rica's President also co-authored an op-ed calling for a collective and collaborative response to the coronavirus.    A new   Technology Access Pool to share data & intellectual property will give all countries & companies a chance to become a part of the solution for life-saving tools to benefit everyone, everywhere.

    being active at home and showing kindness to each other.  The video has been produced in support of the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. 27 May 2020  The Executive Group of the Solidarity Trial, representing 10 of the participating countries, met on 23 May 2020 and agreed to review a comprehensive analysis and critical appraisal of all evidence available globally, in light of publications of non-randomised observational evidence on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.  The review will consider data collected so far in the Solidarity Trial and in particular robust randomised available data, to adequately evaluate the potential benefits and harms from hydroxychloroquine. Deciding to err towards a conservative approach, the Executive Group has implemented a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within the Solidarity Trial while the safety data is reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee. The other arms of the trial are continuing. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria.   26 May 2020    WHO prescription for a healthy & green   recovery: 🌱Protect nature 🚰Invest in essential services 💡Ensure a quick healthy energy transition 🥦Promote healthy, sustainable food systems 🏙Build healthy, liveable cities ❌Stop using taxpayers’ 💸 to fund pollution      22 May 2020 
     COVID 19 is disrupting life-saving immunization services around the world, putting millions of children – in rich and poor countries alike – at risk of diseases like diphtheria, measles and polio. 
     Provision of routine immunization services is substantially hindered in at least 68 countries and is likely to affect approximately 80 million children under the age of 1 living in these countries.
     Since March 2020, routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a global scale that may be unprecedented since the inception of expanded programs on immunization (EPI) in the 1970s. 
     The reasons for disrupted services vary. Some parents are reluctant to leave home because of restrictions on movement, lack of information or because they fear infection with the COVID-19 virus. And many health workers are unavailable because of restrictions
    on travel, or redeployment to COVID response duties, as well as a lack of protective equipment. Transport delays of vaccines are also exacerbating the situation.
     Despite the challenges, several countries are making special efforts to continue immunization. Uganda is ensuring that immunization services continue along with other essential health services, even funding transportation to ensure outreach activities.
    And in Lao PDR, despite a national lockdown imposed in March, routine immunization in fixed sites continued with physical distancing measures in place. "Any suspension of childhood vaccination services is a major threat to life. WHO is working with governments around the world to ensure supply chains remain open and lifesaving health services are reaching all communities"-

 WHO signed a new agreement with the UN Refugee Agency, with a key aim for 2020 of supporting ongoing efforts to protect some 70 million forcibly displaced people from COVID-19. Around 26 million of these people are refugees, 80 per cent of whom are sheltered
    in low and middle-income countries with weak health systems. Another 40 million internally displaced people also require assistance. UNHCR also joined the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which has raised $214m to date. The Fund contributed $10 million to support UNHCR's work on urgent needs related to community engagement, hygiene and medical supplies, isolation units and global
    preparedness activities.   21 May 2020  In collaboration with WHO and the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP), the Smithsonian Science Education Center has developed a new rapid-response guide for youth ages 8–17.  “COVID-19! How can I protect myself and others" is based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals and aims to help young people understand the science and social science of COVID-19.  Integrating inquiry-based science education with social and emotional learning and civic engagement, it looks to help them take actions to keep themselves, their families and communities safe.
 The Smithsonian Science Education Center will disseminate the information to youth worldwide in collaboration with WHO, IAP, educators, and museum and research center networks. The guide is free and will be available to youth in more than 15 languages,
    particularly African and Asian languages.

 Verified is a UN initiative to encourage us all to check the advice we share, as the world can only contain the coronavirus if every person has access to accurate, reliable information.  By promoting and sharing Verified content – marked by a double tick – everyday people can play a crucial role by giving reliable information about COVID-19 to their friends, families and social networks, with the goal of saving lives and countering
    misinformation.  Organisations, businesses, civil society and media platforms can partner with Verified to spread information that helps protect people, communities and forges connections across the planet.
 Verified’s team of communicators, creatives and researchers produce content based on the latest information and guidance from the UN, WHO and other UN agencies. The team works with leading experts on misinformation, First Draft.   21 May 2020 Compared with only using COVID-19 confirmed deaths as a measure of impact, rapid mortality surveillance generates daily or weekly counts of mortality data by age, sex, date of death, place of death and place of usual residence.  This surveillance provides a more complete picture of impact, particularly for deaths that may be indirectly related to COVID-19. It also addresses the indirect impact caused by disruptions in healthcare access and supply chains.  When policy-makers can compare estimated weekly number of excess deaths related to COVID-19 compared with pre-pandemic levels, they have a powerful tool to inform their national response and recovery planning.   Countries need real-time mortality data for an effective   response. WHO together with   &   released a new technical package on rapid mortality surveillance          19 May 2020 At today’s meeting of the 73rd World Health Assembly —its first-ever to be held virtually—delegates adopted a landmark resolution to bring the world together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The resolution, co-sponsored by more than 130 countries, was adopted by consensus. It calls for the intensification of efforts to control the pandemic, and for equitable access to and fair distribution of all essential health technologies and products to combat the virus. It also calls for an independent and comprehensive evaluation
    of the global response, including, but not limited to, WHO’s performance. As WHO convened ministers of health from almost every country in the world, the consistent message throughout the two-day meeting—including from the 14 heads of state participating in the opening and closing sessions —was that global unity
    is the most powerful tool to combat the outbreak. The resolution is a concrete manifestation of this call, and a roadmap for controlling the outbreak. In his closing remarks to the Assembly, the DIrector-General outlined how WHO is fighting COVID-19 with every tool at its disposal.    "  has robbed us of people we love; It’s robbed us of lives and livelihoods; It’s shaken the foundations of our world; It threatens to tear at the fabric of international cooperation"-     As with the opening, leaders from around the world spoke during the closing of the Assembly.    Huge thanks to 🇨🇴 President  🇵🇾 President  🇧🇹   Tshering 🇪🇸 PM  🇮🇹 PM  🇹🇻 PM Natano 🇻🇳 PM Phuc  🇪🇺 President  for their support to   in the   response and during the  .

     The Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee (IOAC) provides regular reporting on WHO’s emergencies programme. It was set up at the same time as the programme. 
     The IOAC interim report notes that WHO responded more quickly than in previous emergencies and “demonstrated leadership and has made important progress in its COVID-19 response.” The report also provides recommendations for WHO and Member
    States on how to improve the COVID-19 response. WHO welcomes the committee’s report, which is part of existing mechanisms to review WHO’s work and ensure a constant feedback loop to improve performance.   Every country and every organization must examine its response and learn from its experience. WHO is committed to transparency, accountability and continuous improvement. 👉

    noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The agreement has a special focus on preventing NCDs through sport. Other areas of collaboration include working with host countries to ensure the health of athletes, supporters and workers at the games as well as addressing NCD risk factors, including water quality and air pollution. The two institutions will also work
    to ensure that the games leave a healthy legacy in host countries through enhanced awareness of the value of sport and physical activity. The two organizations also intend to work together promote grassroots and community sports programmes that have a further reach within the general public, particularly among girls, older people and people living with disability who may find it harder
    to keep active and healthy. Together we will: -Advocate for physical activity -  & promote healthier lifestyles -Strengthen the health legacy of major sporting events -Promote grassroots & community sports programmes  -Strengthen collaboration between Ministries of Sport & Ministries of Health  
   16 May 2020  Ahead of the first-ever virtual World Health Assembly (WHA), WHO explains what WHO is, what we do, our work to fight COVID-19, what the WHA is, how WHA will work in 2020 and why both WHO and WHA matter so much right now.  This year, the 73rd WHA will mostly focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States will deliver statements, report their progress in fighting coronavirus, share knowledge on the evolving situation and consider a draft resolution on COVID-19. 16 May 2020  Professor Devi Sridhar, Chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, helped preview the first-ever virtual World Health Assembly (WHA).  She presented WHA as an opportunity for countries to report on progress and what they need in the response to COVID-19. Describing science as the "true exit strategy", Professor Sridar also sees WHA as a chance to further develop the research and development
    roadmap focused on the coronavirus.  Professor Sridhar outlined how WHO was created to respond to events like the COVID-19 pandemic, as a normative and technical agency that supports member states. She also explained the International Health Regulations, Emergency Committee and significance
    of declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern – among many other topics.    15 May 2020  Presidents Carlos Alvarado Quesada of Costa Rica and Sebastián Piñera of Chile joined WHO's Director-General to announce progress on a technology platform that aims to lift access barriers to effective vaccines, medicines and other health
    products against COVID-19. The platform will pool data, knowledge and intellectual property for existing or new COVID-19 health products to deliver ‘global public goods’ for all people and all countries. Through the open sharing of science and data, numerous companies
    will be able to access the information they need to produce the technologies, thereby scaling up availability worldwide, lowering costs and increasing access.  "WHO has accepted this visionary proposal and will, in the next few weeks, launch a platform for open, collaborative sharing of knowledge, data and intellectual property on existing and new health tools to combat  "-   15 May 2020  Relatively few cases of infants confirmed to have COVID-19 have been reported; those who are infected have experienced mild illness. Recently, however, reports from Europe and North America have described clusters of children and adolescents requiring admission to intensive care units with a multisystem inflammatory condition with some features similar to those of Kawasaki disease
    and toxic shock syndrome.  It is essential to characterize this syndrome and its risk factors, to understand causality, and describe treatment interventions. It is not yet clear the full spectrum of disease, and whether the geographical distribution in Europe and North America
    reflects a true pattern, or if the condition has simply not been recognized elsewhere. There is therefore an urgent need for collection of standardized data describing clinical presentations, severity, outcomes, and epidemiology. WHO has developed a preliminary case definition and case report form for multisystem inflammatory disorder in
    children and adolescents. The case definition will be revised as more data become available.  In addition to more detail on the above, the Scientific Brief also includes information on the preliminary case definition and Global COVID-19 Clinical Data Platform.    14 May 2020  The pandemic is impacting women and men differently.  From risk of exposure and biological susceptibility to infection to the social and economic implications, individuals’ experiences are likely to vary according to their biological and gender characteristics and their interaction with other social
    determinants.
     COVID-19 strategic plans must be grounded in strong gender analysis and ensure meaningful participation of women and girls in decision-making and implementation. WHO calls on its Member States and all global actors to guide investments in quality and gender-sensitive research on the adverse health, social and economic impacts of COVID-19. Countries are advised to incorporate a focus on gender into their COVID-19 responses in order to ensure that public health policies and measures to curb the pandemic account for gender and how it interacts with other inequalities.     13 May 2020 The WHO Academy app provides health workers with access to up-to the-minute guidance, tools, training, and virtual workshops that will help them care for COVID-19 patients and protect themselves. The app is built around the needs expressed by 20,000 global health workers in a WHO Academy survey. The WHO Info app aims to inform the general public. Regarding COVID-19, the app will provide updates on the latest case numbers, WHO initiatives, partnerships and the race to find medicines and vaccines for fighting the disease.     13 May 2020 An increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety are already being reported in a number of countries in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. A study in Ethiopia in April 2020 reported a 3-fold increase in the prevalence of symptoms of depression compared
        to estimates from before the epidemic. Frontline health-care workers, women, children, adolescents, older persons and people with pre-existing mental health conditions are all at particular risk. A rise in alcohol consumption is another area of concern for mental health experts. The increase in people in need of mental health or psychosocial support has been compounded by the interruption to mental health services in many countries.  In concrete terms, it is critical that people living with mental health conditions have continued access to treatment. Many countries have changed their approach to the provision of this support in ways that are showing signs of success. Support for community actions that strengthen social cohesion and reduce loneliness, particularly for the most vulnerable, must also continue. It is vital that people living with   conditions have continued access to treatment during  .  🇺🇳 policy brief suggests ways for countries to make this happen 👉       11 May 2020 'Stop The Spread' will reach audiences across Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East and Latin America. The UK government will offer a toolkit of the campaign assets to partner governments to translate and use in their countries to ensure a unified message across borders.   11 May 2020  COVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases. Tobacco is also a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular
        disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes which put people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID-19.  WHO is constantly evaluating new research, including research that examines the link between tobacco use, nicotine use, and COVID-19. A review of studies by public health experts convened by WHO on 29 April 2020 found that smokers are more likely
        to develop severe disease with COVID-19, compared to non-smokers. WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19. There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine
        in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.   There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of  . Researchers, scientists & the media are urged to be cautious about amplifying such unproven claims. 👉        11 May 2020 Dr Pura Rayco-Solon, from WHO's Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health, answered questions on breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. She emphasised that there is no evidence so far that the virus is transmitted through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding provides numerous health and developmental benefits for both infants and mothers.   11 May 2020  New modelling on HIV convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS highlights the importance of taking immediate steps to minimise interruptions in health services and supplies of antiretroviral drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The worst case scenario considered by the modelling group was a 6-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy. The group suggested that this could lead to more than 500 000 extra deaths from AIDS-related illnesses, including from tuberculosis, in sub-Saharan
    Africa over the next year.  At a media briefing today the WHO Director-General said that the modelling should be a “wake-up call,” and that despite attention being focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, we must still ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments
    for both HIV and TB reach the countries and communities that need them most.   "The group’s worst case scenario, a 6-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy, suggests that there could be 500,000 extra deaths from  -related illnesses, including from  , in sub-Saharan Africa over the next year"-         10 May 2020 This guidance document provides an overview of strategies that Member States should consider as part of comprehensive national surveillance for COVID-19. It emphasises the need to adapt and reinforce existing national systems where appropriate and to scale-up surveillance capacities as needed. Generally speaking, digital technologies for rapid reporting, data management, and analysis will be helpful. Robust comprehensive surveillance should be maintained even in areas where there are few or no cases; it is critical that new cases and clusters are detected rapidly and before widespread disease transmission occurs. Ongoing surveillance is also important to understand longer-term trends in the disease and the evolution of the virus.  Surveillance can be community-based and take place at the primary care level. Existing sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) is useful to monitor COVID-19 transmission trends. There should also be enhanced surveillance for residential facilities and vulnerable groups. 10 May 2020  Contact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent onward transmission. When systematically applied, contact tracing will break the chains of transmission of COVID-19 and is an essential public health tool for controlling the virus.  Contact tracing for COVID-19 requires identifying people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and following them up daily for 14 days from the last point of exposure.  This document provides guidance on how to establish contact tracing capacity for the control of COVID-19, covering issues such as the ideal profile of a contact tracer and what to do if a contact cannot be reached.  Critical elements of the implementation of contact tracing are community engagement and public support; careful planning and consideration of local contexts, communities, and cultures; a workforce of trained contact tracers and supervisors; logistics support to contact tracing teams; and a system to collate, compile, and analyse data in real-time.   10 May 2020  New guidance from WHO outlines measures to protect against COVID-19 in workplaces.  It covers carrying out a workplace risk assessment and outlines measures for all workplaces in the areas of hand and respiratory hygiene; physical distancing; reduction and management of work-related travel; regular environmental cleaning and disinfection;
    risk communication, training and education; and management of people with COVID-19 or their contacts. There are also specific measures for workplaces and jobs at medium and high risk.  In addition, the guidance provides an overview of the rights, duties and responsibilities of workers and employers, as well as advice on developing action plans for COVID-19 prevention and mitigation.  This document is an Annex to existing WHO guidance on 'Considerations in adjusting public health and social measures in the context of COVID-19'.   "WHO issued detailed new workplace guidelines, which recommend all places of work carry out a risk assessment for workers potential exposure to  . This includes the implementation of measures to prevent the spread of the virus"-         10 May 2020 New guidance released this week outlines what should be considered when deciding to close or reopen schools, what we know about COVID-19 and children, and questions to ask in assessing the ability to maintain prevention and control measures.  To reopen schools, the document recommends measures relating to hygiene and daily practices, as well as physical distancing and tele-schooling. It also covers monitoring of schools after re-opening.  The document was developed in consultation with UNICEF, IFRC and WHO Regional Offices. It is an Annex to existing WHO guidance on 'Considerations in adjusting public health and social measures in the context of COVID-19'.   "2⃣ the epidemiology of   where the school is geographically located needs to be considered 3⃣the ability to maintain COVID-19 prevention and control measures within the school setting"-     9 May 2020 Der Spiegel reports of a 21 January, 2020, telephone conversation between WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and President Xi Jingping of China are unfounded and untrue. Dr Tedros and President Xi did not speak on 21 January and they have never spoken by telephone. Such inaccurate reports distract and detract from WHO’s and the world’s efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic. To note: China confirmed human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus on 20 January. 8 May 2020    7 May 2020  An update to the UN’s Global Humanitarian Response Plan was launched today by the Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Mike Ryan; UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Mark Lowcock; President and CEO of Oxfam America, Abby Maxman; UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi; and Executive Director of the World Food Programme, David Beasley.  Dr Ryan emphasized that helping the most vulnerable to confront COVID-19 is not just a moral imperative, it is in enlightened self interest: "It is not only the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. We won't be safe – anywhere on this planet – until all people are safe."     7 May 2020  COVID-19 prevention and control measures can be difficult to implement in humanitarian crises or places with low capacity. Testing, isolating and treating people with COVID-19 and tracing their contacts is also challenging in places with weaker health
        systems.  Public health and social measures in these settings must be balanced against other risks, such as lack of income, limited access to basic services, food insecurity, and lack of a social safety net. Measures also need to be pragmatic and leverage the
        strengths of local structures and systems, notably through social mobilization and strong community engagement.  This interim guidance outlines how to adapt COVID-19 prevention and response measures for use in low capacity and humanitarian settings.    WHO's mission is: promote health, keep the world safe, serve the vulnerable. This means delivering  , everywhere, including in areas affected by war and conflict. The most important tool to fight  ,   and other disease outbreaks is peace.        6 May 2020  Since first learning of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China on 31 December, WHO has been responding rapidly, working to help countries, communities and individuals keep safe from COVID-19. WHO has issued guidance, convened scientists, called for more equipment for health workers and more.    6 May 2020 In an answer to a journalist's question, WHO's Legal Counsel Derek Walton outlined that the World Health Assembly on 18 and 19 May 2020 will be held virtually, as a de minimis session, which means it will focus principally on the COVID-19 pandemic.  He went on to explain that the involvement of observers is a question for the member governments of WHO and that WHO's Secretariat does not decide on such matters.    5 May 2020 Hand Hygiene Day mobilizes people around the world to increase adherence to hand hygiene in health care facilities. This year, the campaign theme, “Save Lives: Clean your hands”, is aligned with the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife

The transition out of lockdown is set to be a complex and uncertain phase. Challenges and circumstances vary from country to country and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. It is vital that countries clearly communicate this to the public to build
    trust and ensure that people observe restrictions specific to their situation.

    769 000, twice the number of deaths reported in the region in 2018. This would represent a return to malaria mortality levels last seen 20 years ago. Countries across the region have a critical window of opportunity to minimize disruptions in malaria prevention and treatment and save lives at this stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.   Countries in sub-Saharan Africa need to move fast & distribute   prevention & treatment tools at this stage of the   outbreak to avoid an increase in malaria related deaths  👉     WHO and partners have developed guidance on the prevention of infection through vector control and chemoprevention, testing, treatment of cases, clinical services, supply chain and laboratory activities.     20 April 2020  WHO and the World Trade Organization (WTO) are collaborating to secure vital medical supply lines - ensuring normal cross-border flows and resolving unnecessary disruptions to global supply chains.  In a joint statement, WHO and WTO called on Members to continue to ensure that health technologies – including diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and supplies vital to treating COVID-19 patients – reach those in need quickly.   Global action, solidarity and international cooperation are more necessary than ever to address the   pandemic.   and   are working together to play their part.

However, a number of medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies, many of which are now being or will soon be studied in clinical trials, including the SOLIDARITY trial co-sponsored by WHO and participating countries.  In many countries, doctors are giving COVID-19 patients medicines that have not been approved for this disease. The use of licensed medicines for indications that have not been approved by a national medicines regulatory authority is considered “off-label” use. The prescription of medicines for off-label use by doctors may be subject to national laws and regulations. All health care workers should be aware of and comply with the laws and regulations governing their practice. Further, such prescribing should be done on a case-by-case basis. Unnecessary stockpiling and the creation of shortages of approved medicines that are required to treat other diseases should be avoided.  It can be ethically appropriate to offer individual patients experimental interventions on an emergency basis outside clinical trials, provided that no proven effective treatment exists; it is not possible to initiate clinical studies immediately; the patient or his or her legal representative has given informed consent; and the emergency use of the intervention is monitored, and the results are documented and shared in a timely manner with the wider medical and scientific community. The decision to offer a patient an unproven or experimental treatment is between the doctor and the patient but must comply with national law. Where it is possible and feasible for the treatment to be given as part of a clinical trial, this should be done unless the patient declines to participate in the trial.  If it is not possible to give the treatment as part of a clinical trial, appropriate records of the use of the medicine must be kept, in compliance with national law, and outcomes for patients should be monitored and recorded.  If early results from an unproven or experimental treatment are promising, the treatment should be studied in the context of a formal clinical trial to establish its safety, efficacy, risks, and benefits.        WHO and FIFA launched the “Pass the message to kick out coronavirus” campaign, led by world-renowned footballers.

If people test positive, they should be isolated and the people they have been in close contact with up to 2 days before they developed symptoms should be sought out, and those people should be tested too if they show symptoms of COVID-19.  WHO also advises that all confirmed cases, even mild cases, should be isolated in health facilities, to prevent transmission and provide adequate care. But we recognize that many countries have already exceeded their capacity to care for mild cases in dedicated health facilities. In that situation, countries should prioritize older patients and those with underlying conditions.   "We have a simple message for all countries: test test test. Test every suspected   case.

We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death. Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this virus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do.

Every effort to contain the virus and slow the spread saves lives. These efforts give health systems and all of society much needed time to prepare, and researchers more time to identify effective treatments and develop vaccines.  Allowing uncontrolled spread should not be a choice of any government, as it will harm not only the citizens of that country but affect other countries as well.  We must stop, contain, control, delay and reduce the impact of this virus at every opportunity.

This wealth of knowledge is unprecedented for a new disease.     3 Mar 2020 WHO has shipped nearly half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 47 countries, but the global supply is rapidly depleting. Shortages are leaving doctors, nurses and other frontline workers dangerously ill-equipped to care for COVID-19 patients, due to limited access to supplies such as gloves, medical masks, respirators, goggles, face shields, gowns, and aprons. 2 March 2020 Speaking at the COVID-19 media briefing, the Director-General emphasized that the virus is capable of community transmission but can be contained with the right measures.  Our message to all countries is: this is not one-way street.

LIVE   on   with      25 February 2020 The WHO Director-General has repeatedly called for "solidarity, not stigma" to address COVID-19.  WHO has worked with UNICEF and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies on a guide to preventing and addressing the social stigma associated with the disease.  It's vital to fight stigma because it can drive people to hide the illness, not seek health care immediately and discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours.  This guide includes some tips and messages, as well as dos and don'ts on language when talking about COVID-19.  Given that   is a new disease, it is understandable that its emergence and spread cause confusion, anxiety and fear among the general public. These factors can give rise to harmful stereotypes.     25 February 2020 The team of 25 international and Chinese experts travelled to several different provinces, with a small group going to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Among the team's findings was that the epidemic peaked and plateaued between the 23rd of January and the 2nd of February, and has been declining steadily since then. The team also estimates that the measures taken in China have averted a significant number
    of cases. In a press conference in Geneva on Tuesday 25 February, Dr Bruce Aylward, the mission's lead, reported back on what China has done, its impact and implications.  24 February 2020  A team of experts from WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) will focus on: understanding how events developed, learning from the Italian experience and supporting control and prevention efforts by the authorities.  To limit further human to human transmission, WHO experts will provide support in the areas of clinical management, infection prevention and control, surveillance and risk communication. Joint team of   and   is set and ready to help   on the ground with ✅ clinical management ✅ infection control ✅ surveillance ✅ risk communication. Top priority to understand and retain   transmission. 24 February 2020 UN Secretary-General António Guterres met with the WHO Director-General and other WHO leaders, receiving a briefing on COVID-19, Ebola and polio. He expressed great admiration for health workers, including in China, who are working tirelessly to
    save lives. The UN Secretary-General also stressed that there is no space for stigma and discrimination and said we must be guided by science and human rights-based interventions. As our   colleagues continue their relentless work in response to the   outbreak, I urge people worldwide to continue following their advice. We need to rely on science and facts, not stigma and discrimination to get through this   outbreak.  "My strong appeal to all countries is to assume their responsibilities and to know that they can fully count on the   to support them in that effort," -- UN Secretary-General visits the World Health Organization, meets with  , discusses   outbreak.  22 February 2020 WHO’s Director-General and Regional Director for Africa addressed an emergency meeting of ministers of health to agree on a continental strategy for Africa to strengthen preparedness and responses to the COVID-19 outbreak. It’s great to see African leadership in action. Today’s meeting on   convened by the   and attended by   and partners is a powerful demonstration of collective political commitment to tackling    22 February 2020 During the past month about 11 000 African health workers have been trained using WHO’s online courses on COVID-19, which are available free of charge in English, French & other languages.

        for the opportunity. I will contribute as best I can to the collective response effort.  — Dr David Nabarro (@davidnabarro)  21 February 2020 Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasised that the window of opportunity to contain the outbreak is “narrowing” and that the international community needs to act quickly, including through financing. Countries with weaker health systems need the 🌍's focus & support now, due to the potential for   to spread to those locations. We must take advantage of the window of opportunity we have to contain the outbreak. We don't want to look back later & regret failing to act. 18 February 2020 WHO has shipped supplies of personal protective equipment to 21 countries. By the end of this week, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are due to have the ability to detect COVID-19.   17 February 2020 Based on lessons from H1N1 and Ebola, WHO has outlined planning considerations for organizers of mass gatherings, in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. It has also issued advice on how to detect and take care of ill travellers, who are suspected COVID-19 cases.    15 February 2020   "We must be guided by solidarity, not stigma. The greatest enemy we face is not the virus itself; it’s the stigma that turns us against each other. We must stop stigma and hate." WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on the international community to use the window of opportunity to prepare for COVID-19 at the  , a leading global forum on preeminent crises and future security challenges.     12 February 2020 The Crisis Management Team (CMT) mechanism brings together WHO,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , the   and several UN Secretariat departments.  The CMT will be managed by the Executive Director of WHO Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Mike Ryan. It will help WHO focus on the health response while the other agencies will bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak. 12 February 2020  More than 400 experts and funders met at WHO’s Geneva HQ to accelerate research to stop the COVID-19 outbreak. Featuring updates from the frontlines of the response in China, the meeting addressed issues such as: developing easy-to-apply diagnostics,
    accelerating existing vaccine candidates and preventing infection.  11 February 2020 Guidelines mandated that the name of the disease could not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people. It also needed to relate to the disease and be pronounceable. This choice will help guard against the use of other
    names that might be inaccurate or stigmatizing. 🚨 BREAKING 🚨 "We now have a name for the   disease:  COVID-19.  I’ll spell it: C-O-V-I-D hyphen one nine – COVID-19" -     5 February 2020 With the 2019-nCoV outbreak set to test the resilience of countries, the US$675 million   (SPRP) aims to protect states with weaker health systems.  Covering areas ranging from international coordination to country readiness to research and innovation, the SPRP aims to limit transmission, provide early care, communicate key information and minimize social and economic impacts.  30 January 2020 WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, following a second meeting of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations.   28 January 2020 WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus met with China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing about the coronavirus outbreak.  Dr Tedros was joined by WHO Regional Director Dr Takeshi Kasai and Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme Dr Mike Ryan, and also met State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi and Minister of Health Ma Xiaowei. The discussions focused on continued collaboration on containment measures in Wuhan, public health measures in other cities and provinces, conducting further studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, continuing to share data, and for
    China to share biological material with WHO. These measures will advance scientific understanding of the virus and contribute to the development of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and treatments. The two sides agreed that WHO would send international experts to visit China as soon as possible to work with Chinese counterparts on increasing understanding of the outbreak to guide global response efforts. Stopping the spread of the new   both in   and globally is  ’s
 highest priority. We are working closely with the 🇨🇳 government on measures to understand the virus and limit transmission.  — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros)  25 January 2020 Covering topics such as why the novel coronavirus is a global threat to human health and how to effectively engage communities in the response, this free online course gives an introduction to the novel coronavirus. It is available for free and online
    in English, French, Spanish and Chinese.  from   on  OpenWHO course:  23 January 2020 On 22-23 February, the WHO Director General convened the Emergency Committee to consider the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China, with cases also reported in the Republic of Korea, Japan, Thailand and Singapore.  Several Committee members considered it still too early to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), given its restrictive and binary nature. Among other recommendations, the Committee advised that it be recalled in approximately 10 days. 21 January 2020 The delegation observed and discussed active surveillance processes, temperature screening at Wuhan Tianhe airport, laboratory facilities, infection prevention and control measures at Zhongnan hospital and its associated fever clinics, and the deployment of a test kit to detect the virus. The delegation also discussed public communication efforts and China's plan to expand the case definition for the novel coronavirus, which will build a clearer picture of the spectrum of severity of the virus. At the end of the visit, the Chinese Government released the primers and probes used in the test kit for the novel coronavirus to help other countries detect it. Chinese experts also shared a range of protocols that will be used in developing international guidelines, including case definitions, clinical management protocols and infection control. 13 January 2020 Officials confirmed a case of the novel coronavirus in Thailand. It was not unexpected that cases of the novel coronavirus would emerge outside of China and reinforces why WHO calls for active monitoring and preparedness in other countries. On 13 January 2020, the 🇹🇭 ’s Ministry of Public Health   reported the first imported case of lab-confirmed novel   (2019-nCoV) from  ,  🇨🇳    11 - 12 January 2020 China shares the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, which will be very important for other countries as they develop specific diagnostic kits. 10 January 2020 Developed with reference to other coronaviruses, such as   and  , WHO issued a tool for countries to check their ability to detect and respond to a novel coronavirus.  This information is to help with identifying main gaps, assessing risks and planning for additional investigations, response and control actions.   5 January 2020 WHO published its risk assessment and advice and reported on the status of patients and the public health response by national authorities to the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.   
 4 January 2020 WHO announced it would work across its 3 levels – country office, regional office and HQ – to track the situation and share details as they emerged.   has reported to WHO a cluster of   cases —with no deaths— in Wuhan, Hubei Province 🇨🇳 . Investigations are underway to identify the cause of this illness. 31 December 2019 At the close of 2019, the WHO China Country Office was informed of a pneumonia of unknown cause, detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or vendors in the Huanan Seafood
    market.  Staying in close contact with national authorities, WHO began monitoring the situation and requested further information on the laboratory tests performed and the different diagnoses considered.

     There are three parameters to understand in order to assess the magnitude of the risk posed by this novel coronavirus:  The   or   (how rapidly the disease spreads) of a virus is indicated by its reproductive number (Ro, pronounced   or  ), which represents the average number of people to which a single infected person will transmit the virus. WHO's estimated (on Jan. 23) Ro to be between 1.4 and 2.5.  Other studies have estimated a Ro between 3.6 and 4.0, and between 2.24 to 3.58.  .  Preliminary studies had estimated Ro to be between    An outbreak with a reproductive number of below 1 will gradually disappear. For comparison, the Ro for the common flu is 1.3 and for SARS it was 2.0. The novel coronavirus' case   has been estimated at around  , in the WHO press conference held on January 29, 2020   . However, it noted that, without knowing how many were infected, it was too early to be able to put a percentage on the mortality rate figure.  A prior estimate   had put that number at 3%.  Fatality rate can change as a virus can mutate, according to epidemiologists. For comparison, the case fatality rate for SARS was 10%, and for MERS 34%. Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 (estimated ranges vary from 2-10 days, 2-14 days, and 10-14 days,  ), during which the virus is contagious but the patient does not display any symptom ( ). According to early estimates by China's National Health Commission (NHC), about 80% of those who died were over the age of 60 and 75% of them had
pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and
diabetes. According to the   issued on Jan. 27:
 A study of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP found that the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men.   The WHO, in its  , addresses the question:  by answering that:  
As of Jan. 29, according to French authorities, the conditions of the two earliest Paris cases had worsened and the patients were being treated in intensive care, according to French authorities. The patients have been described as a young couple aged  , both Chinese citizens from Wuhan who were asymptomatic when they arrived in Paris on January 18  .  The NHC reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm on January 22, 2020. The deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median age of the deaths was 75 (range 48-89) years. On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a Global Public Health Emergency.

	Since the coronavirus pandemic first began, evidence has emerged showing that COVID-19 can damage more than the lungs. 
	The disease caused by the novel coronavirus can   -- including the heart -- and now two separate studies, published in the journal JAMA Cardiology on Monday, provide more insight into how COVID-19 may have a prolonged impact on heart health in those who have recovered from illness and may have caused cardiac infection in those who died. 
	"We've understood for a few months now that COVID-19 is not only a respiratory infection but a multi-system infection," said cardiologist Dr. Nieca Goldberg, medical director of the NYU Women's Heart Program and senior adviser for women's health strategy at NYU Langone Health in New York, who was not involved in either study. 
	"There is an acute inflammatory response, increased blood clotting and cardiac involvement. And the cardiac involvement can either be due to direct involvement of the heart muscle by the infection and its inflammatory response. It could be due to blood clots that are formed, causing an obstruction of arteries," Goldberg said. 
	"Sometimes people have very fast heart rates that can, over time, weaken the heart muscle, reduce the heart muscle function. So there are multiple ways during this infection that it can involve the heart." 
	One of the   found that, among 100 adults who recently recovered from COVID-19, 78% showed some type of cardiac involvement in MRI scans and 60% had ongoing inflammation in the heart. 
	The study included patients ages 45 to 53 who were from the University Hospital Frankfurt COVID-19 Registry in Germany. They were recruited for the study between April and June. Most of the patients -- 67-- recovered at home, with the severity of their illness ranging from some being asymptomatic to having moderate symptoms. 
	The researchers used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, blood tests and biopsy of heart tissue. Those data were compared with a group of 50 healthy volunteers and 57 volunteers with some underlying health conditions or risk factors. 
	The MRI data revealed that people infected with coronavirus had some sort of heart involvement regardless of any preexisting conditions, the severity or course of their infection, the time from their original diagnosis or the presence of any specific heart-related symptoms. 
	The most common heart-related abnormality in the COVID-19 patients was myocardial inflammation or abnormal inflammation of the heart muscle, which can weaken it. 
	This type of inflammation, also called myocarditis, is usually caused by a viral infection, Goldberg said, adding that she was not surprised by these study results. 
	"What they're saying in this study is that you can identify myocardial involvement or heart involvement by magnetic resonance imaging," Goldberg said. 
	The study has some limitations. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of patients, those younger than 18 and those currently battling coronavirus infection instead of just recovering from it. 
	"These findings indicate the need for ongoing investigation of the long-term cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19," the researchers wrote. 
	In the other JAMA Cardiology study, an   found that coronavirus could be identified in the heart tissue of COVID-19 patients who died. 
	The study included data from 39 autopsy cases from Germany between April 8 and April 18. The patients, ages 78 to 89, had tested positive for COVID-19 and the researchers analyzed heart tissue from their autopsies. 
	The researchers found that 16 of the patients had virus in their heart tissue, but did not show signs of unusual sudden inflammation in the heart or myocarditis. It's not clear what this means, the researchers said. 
	The sample of autopsy cases was small and the "elderly age of the patients might have influenced the results," the researchers wrote. More research is needed whether similar findings would emerge among a younger group of patients. 
	"I think both of these studies are important," Goldberg said. 
	"One pretty much shows that the MRI scan can help diagnose the myocardial injury that occurs due to Covid and it was confirmed on biopsy," she said. "The autopsy study showed us something else that's interesting -- that you can have viral presence but not the acute inflammatory process. So this infection does not follow one path." 
	Both studies "add to an increasingly complex puzzle" when it comes to the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, Dr. Dave Montgomery, founding cardiologist at the PREvent Clinic in Sandy Springs, Georgia, said in an email on Tuesday. 
	"Taken together the studies support that SARS-CoV-2 does not have to cause clinical myocarditis in order to find the virus in large numbers and the inflammatory response in myocardial tissue. In other words, one can have no or mild symptoms of heart involvement in order to actually cause damage," said Montgomery, who was not involved in the studies. 
	"Viruses in general have a way of making their way to organs that are quite remote from the original site of infection. SARS-CoV-2 is no different in this regard," he said. "What is different is that this virus seems to preferentially affect cardiac cells and the surrounding cells. These studies suggest that the heart can be infected with no clear signs. Personally, in my practice, we have seen similar signs of inflammation, including pericardial effusions," or fluid around the sac of the heart. 
	Dr. Clyde Yancy of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Dr. Gregg Fonarow of the University of California, Los Angeles, co-authored an   in the journal JAMA Cardiology on Monday. 
	"We see the plot thickening and we are inclined to raise a new and very evident concern that cardiomyopathy and heart failure related to COVID-19 may potentially evolve as the natural history of this infection becomes clearer," Yancy and Fonarow wrote in the editorial. 
	"We wish not to generate additional anxiety but rather to incite other investigators to carefully examine existing and prospectively collect new data in other populations to con- firm or refute these findings," they wrote.

 ,    
	For the first time in more than four months, Ontario reported fewer than 100 new cases of COVID-19. 
	Provincial health officials say 76 new cases of the virus were reported today, down from 111 one day prior. 
	This is the first time since March 24 that the province saw fewer than 100 new infections and it is the lowest day-over-day increase since March 22, when the province was in the early stages of the pandemic. 
	It should be noted that the case positivity rate is substantially lower now than in March, as testing capacity was limited to about 2,500 per day at that time. 
	More than 27,000 tests were completed over the past 24 hours, resulting in a case positivity rate of just 0.28 per cent. More than 18,000 cases are still under investigation. 
	According to the latest data, 28 regions in the province reported five or fewer new cases today and with 174 more resolved cases, recoveries outpaced new infections by 98. 
	Premier Doug Ford called today's case numbers "impressive" but urged people to continue to be cautious. 
	"We can't take our eye off the ball for a second. It will come back and bite us in the backside, this second wave, like we've never seen before. So by no means is this over," he said at Queen's Park on Wednesday afternoon.  
	"I emphasize, do no, do not have parties. Do not have these big gatherings because we are risking everything."  
	Of the new cases reported today, 39 were in patients ages 39 and under while 35 were in people 40 and older, a departure from a developing trend that saw new cases spiking in people under 40. 
	The highest number of new infections were reported in Windsor-Essex (22), Niagara Region (13), Chatham-Kent (10) and York Region (9). 
	In today's epidemiological summary, the province said several cases that were initially reported as positive in Toronto were actually negative and were subtracted from Wednesday's number, resulting in a total of -13 today. 
	Just four new cases were reported today in Peel Region. 
	The encouraging numbers come on the same day the Ontario government gave Toronto and Peel the green light to advance to Stage 3, allowing many additional businesses to reopen and indoor dining to resume on Friday. 
	"While more restaurants, theatres and businesses can hang up their Open for Business sign, we're asking everyone to follow public health advice and act responsibly," Ford said in a press release issued on Wednesday. 
	"We have made tremendous progress that allows us to return to something a little closer to our normal lives this summer, but we are not out of the woods yet." 
	Windsor-Essex is the only region that remains in Stage 2. 
	One additional death was reported in the province today, bringing the total number of virus-related deaths in Ontario to 2,769. 
	The total number of lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario now sits at 38,986 and with 34,741 cases considered to be resolved, the number of active infections is down to 1,476. 
	Hospitalizations also continue to decline in the province. 
	Officials say 91 patients are currently in hospital with COVID-19 and of those, 28 are in intensive care and 17 are on ventilators. 
	One new outbreak was reported at a long-term care home in the province, bringing the number of active outbreaks in those facilities to 33.

 Nitish Madan / WWF-International / PA Tiger numbers are increasing across five of the countries where the endangered big cat is found, conservationists have said. The number of wild tigers is on the increase in Bhutan, China,  , Nepal and Russia, a decade on from the launch of an ambitious scheme to double the population of the species. The TX2 initiative was launched in 2010 when it was estimated that wild populations of the cat were at a historic low, with as few as 3200 animals remaining across the 13 countries where they are found. The scheme aims to double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022.

                     
 
 
 In India, the number of wild tigers in 2018 is estimated to have been at between 2600 and 3350 animals – around three-quarters of the world’s population, and more than double the number in 2006. Nepal’s population of tigers had nearly doubled by 2018, up from 121 individuals in 2009 to 235. The population in Nepal’s Bardiya National Park alone has increased from just 18 tigers in 2008 to 87 in 2018, conservation charity WWF said. In Russia, Amur tiger numbers have increased by 15 per cent in the past 10 years to around 540 animals, and in Bhutan’s Royal Manas National Park, the population rose from only 10 tigers a decade ago to 22 in 2019. In 2010, China had no more than 20 wild tigers, most of which had crossed the border from Russia. The country recorded a landmark moment in 2014 when camera traps captured footage of a tigress and her cubs in Wangqing Nature Reserve in Jilin province, indicating that tigers were breeding in China again and dispersing into new areas. Becci May at WWF UK, said: “Ten years ago, tigers were in such a perilous state that there was a very real risk of them becoming extinct in the wild. From that population low in 2010, they are finally making a remarkable comeback in much of South Asia, Russia and China, thanks to coordinated and concerted conservation efforts in these countries.” “This is an achievement that not only offers a future for tigers in the wild, but for the landscapes they inhabit and the communities living alongside this iconic big cat,” she said. There are still only about 3900 tigers in the wild. They are under threat from poaching for the illegal wildlife trade, and the destruction and   across much of their range, WWF said. The key to helping wild tiger populations recover is to focus on conserving landscapes where they can thrive and ensuring communities in these wildlife-rich areas are supported and included in conservation, the organisation said.

But in the wild, tiger populations have been in rapid decline for decades now. There is some positive news though, because after years of concern, the number of wild tigers in some areas does now seem to be rising.  New figures by wildlife charity WWF suggest a resurgence in their numbers. Experts are even describing it as a "remarkable comeback". In 2010, there were as few as 3,200 wild tigers. But now five countries - India, China, Nepal, Russia and Bhutan - have given hope for the future. In India alone, the number of wild tigers is now estimated at between 2,600 and 3,350 animals - which makes up around three-quarters of the world's population. Neighbouring Nepal has seen its population of tigers is up from 121 in 2009 to 235 just under a decade later. And it's the same story in Russia, Bhutan and China, where increased sightings of tigers suggest conservation efforts are working. "Tigers can thrive happily given enough space, food or water. So the progress is a result of tigers and their habitat being better protected," Becci May tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Becci is WWF's UK regional manager and says while this is good news, threats still exist to the tiger population. "The reason why numbers have plummeted over the last 100 years or so is because of changes to land use," she says. Loss of habitat, hunting and poaching remains a very real threat. "Wildlife populations are also devastated because of snares being set to catch wildlife," she adds. Recent analysis estimates there are 12.3 million snares threatening wildlife in protected areas of Southeast Asia. Becci says "a real team effort" is needed. "We need to share our enthusiasm for tigers and tell our friends and family how important it is." She says we can ensure the items we buy, such as wood and paper, don't come as a result of illegal logging, which harms tigers. "If you look at the labels, you can see that if you get it from the right source, you may be helping to protect those forests, habitats and tigers." Other countries can learn from the likes of India and Nepal which have seen big increases. "Tiger conservation will not be successful without the support of governments and political will," says Becci. "We need the engagement and support of local communities who are actually living in the areas where the tigers live." That means supporting communities and including them in the conservation efforts. "And with a collective effort, we've shown that we can turn the tide for tigers," she adds. .  The health secretary is expected to announce new guidance for those with symptoms in England on Thursday. Mark Daly investigates on BBC iPlayer now Sign up for our newsletter Camera traps recorded three tigers in an area of western Thailand where the big cat had not been seen for four years. Camera traps in a forest in western Thailand have captured footage of in an area where the endangered animals have not been seen for four years, conservation group Panthera said on Wednesday, raising hopes for the species' survival in Southeast Asia. The video and photographs show three male roaming at night, with one walking directly towards the camera and sniffing the lens. "We are excited about this discovery," Kritsana Kaewplang, country director for Panthera in Thailand, said of the footage which was released on Global Tiger Day. There are estimated to be about 160 Indochinese left in the wild in Thailand, which has stepped up .  about 3,900 Kritsana, who has been working with Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation and other organisations, said the sightings mean Thailand is on the right track trying to preserve and their prey. "The next important step for us is that we have to try and make the connecting routes of each forest area accommodating for them, in order for the to roam safely," said Kritsana. A database of Thailand's tiger population showed two of the had come from the northern part of the forest to the south, while the third had not been documented before, she said. "In more than 20 years of fieldwork, it's some of the best (footage) I've seen," said Eileen Larney, the Zoological Society of London's country manager for Thailand. "To witness apex predators, like tigers, returning to forests means the ecosystem is recovering, which is good for all wildlife." The recent success is partly down to specially designed "PoacherCams", Goodrich said. The cameras automatically distinguish between people and animals, sending pictures of potential poachers to local police in real time. . A Conservationists have been calling on the government to deploy soldiers to the forest to combat the theft of the country's unique wildlife, following the lead of countries like India where a "boots on the ground" response has helped tiger numbers recover. "The focus right now needs to be on Southeast Asia, where tigers are in the most trouble," Goodrich told AFP news agency. However, "If you don't have government support, it doesn't work."

	  Advertisement Advertisement With Tiger King shedding light on how big cats can be forced into cruel, unnatural living situations when held in captivity, you can see why it's more important than ever to protect all big cats in the wild and to preserve and restore habitat for these amazing creatures. Defenders of Wildlife protects big cats in North America, like Florida panthers and jaguars, and we tirelessly advocate for human-wildlife coexistence, which should never include making wild animals pets.  The largest of the big cats, tigers are truly impressive animals with their black-striped orange fur and white bellies. A tiger’s stripe pattern is like a fingerprint and can be used to identify individuals. The tiger is the largest member of the felid (cat) family. Tiger taxonomy was revised in 2017 based on new genetic analysis into two subspecies:  , consisting of tiger populations in continental Asia, and  , including populations in the Sunda Islands. Since tigers are not native to North America, Defenders does not work on their conservation directly. Defenders works to ensure that tigers remain protected under the Endangered Species Act, and under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) highlighting their link to jaguar trade. Many of the threats facing   and   in North America, such as habitat loss, road kills and poaching, are also experienced by tigers. Because of this, we work closely with tiger conservationists to better enable human-wildlife coexistence by exchanging innovative and effective tools and technology for protecting livestock and people.  Your adoption supports our work to ensure that tigers remain protected under the Endangered Species Act, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and other international laws and treaties. 
 Tigers face many threats. Their greatest threat is large scale loss of habitat and prey due to human encroachment and habitat degradation for agriculture. Climate change is also causing ocean levels to rise, reducing coastal habitat in areas like India’s Sunderban islands and forcing tigers to move into areas more heavily populated by people. In some parts of their range, tigers are poached because their pelts are valuable in the black market trade in Asia and their other body parts are used in traditional Asian medicine. Tigers are also killed or removed from the wild in efforts to protect livestock and human communities. Finally, as tigers recover in some regions, they come into contact more often with people, pets and livestock, which can increase human-wildlife conflicts if tigers and people are not proactively managed. You can help tigers through being a conscious shopping. Palm oil plantations are replacing tiger habitat in Southeast Asia, so read food ingredient labels to check if the palm oil in your product is sustainably grown. When traveling abroad, do not purchase souvenirs or gifts that may contain tiger products – even products made from ‘tiger substitutes’ can contribute to declines in other endangered species, so it is best to avoid wildlife products entirely. Finally, become big cat savvy by learning about imperiled big cats in North America like the   and  .  Tigers live in 13 range countries across Asia. Tigers occupy a variety of habitats from tropical forests, evergreen forests, woodlands and mangrove swamps to grasslands, savannah and rocky country. In the early 1900s, there were estimated to be around 100,000 tigers throughout their range. Today, around 4,000 tigers live in the wild, while roughly 5,000-7,000 exist in captivity. Tigers are mostly nocturnal (more active at night) and are ambush predators that rely on the camouflage their stripes provide to stalk prey. Tigers use their body weight to knock prey to the ground and kill with a bite to the neck. They are also very good swimmers and have been known to drown their prey. Tigers are territorial and typically live solitary lives, except during mating season and while females raise young. Mating Season: In tropical climates, mostly from around November to April; during the winter months in temperate regions. 
Gestation: 103-105 days. 
Litter size: 3-4 cubs. 
Cubs follow their mother out of the den at around 8 weeks and become independent at around 18 months of age. They leave their mothers at about 2 ½ years. Mothers guard their young from wandering males that may kill the cubs to make the female receptive to mating. Tigers mainly eat sambar deer, wild pigs, water buffalo and antelope. Old and injured tigers have been known to attack domestic cattle and people. 1130 17th Street NW

The tiger is   throughout its range, which stretches from the Russian Far East through parts of  ,  ,  , and   to the Indonesian island of  . The  , or Amur, tiger ( ) is the largest, measuring up to 4 metres (13 feet) in total length and weighing up to 300 kg (660 pounds). The Indian, or  , tiger ( ) is the most numerous and accounts for about half of the total tiger population. Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder height of about 1 metre and a length of about 2.2 metres, excluding a tail of about 1 metre; weight is 160–230 kg (350–500 pounds), and tigers from the south are smaller than those of the north. The   ( ), and   ( ) tigers are bright reddish tan, beautifully marked with dark, almost black, vertical stripes. The underparts, the inner sides of the limbs, the cheeks, and a large spot over each   are whitish. The rare Siberian tiger has longer, softer, and paler fur.  White tigers, not all of them true albinos, have occurred from time to time, almost all of them in India (   ).  Black tigers have been reported less frequently from the dense forests of   (Burma),  , and eastern India. The tiger has no mane, but in old males the hair on the cheeks is rather long and spreading. Although most classifications separate the   into six subspecies, some merge subspecies or suggest that two tiger species exist,   on the mainland of Asia and   of  ,  , and Sumatra. The tiger has adapted to a great variety of  , from the Siberian  , where nights can be as cold as −40 °C (−40 °F), to the   swamps of the  , where the temperatures reach more than 40 °C (104 °F). Tigers haunt the ruins of buildings such as courts and temples and are at home in   ranging from dry   to  . Grasslands, mixed grassland-forests, and   rather than densely canopied forests support maximum population densities, as these habitats maintain the highest number of prey species. Having evolved in the temperate and subtropical forests of eastern Asia, the tiger is less tolerant of   than other large cats, which may explain why it is an adept swimmer that appears to enjoy bathing. Under stress it may climb trees. The tiger usually hunts by night and preys on a variety of animals, but it prefers fairly large prey such as   ( ,  , and swamp deer) and wild  . A special liking for  , despite the danger of injury from their quills, is an exception. Healthy large   are generally avoided, although there have been recorded instances of the tiger’s having attacked   and adult  .   are occasionally taken from human habitations, and some tigers can thrive on domestic  . After making a kill and consuming what it can, it makes a deliberate attempt to hide the carcass from   and other scavengers so that another meal can be obtained. Tigers are not averse to commandeering a kill from other tigers or  , and they sometimes eat carrion. Skill in killing and obtaining prey is only partly instinctive, maternal training being essential for proficiency. For this reason, tigers raised in captivity would not fare well if released into the wild. As the   throughout its range, the tiger plays a major role in controlling not only its prey   but that of other predators such as the leopard,   (Asiatic wild dog), and  . No trait of the tiger has fascinated humans more than  man eating. A number of reasons account for this—disability caused by age or injury, paucity of prey, acquisition of the habit from the mother, or defense of cubs or kill. With the reduction in the number of tigers, the occurrence of man-eating tigers has become rare except in the Sundarbans, the northeast Indian state of  , and neighbouring   in and around Royal Chitwan National Park. As solitary animals, tigers (especially males) establish and maintain their own territories, the size and nature of which vary with the number and distribution of prey, the presence of other tigers in the area, the nature of the terrain, the availability of  , and individual characteristics. Spacing between individuals and maintenance of territories are achieved through  , scrapings on the ground,   marking of  , fecal deposits, scent deposited by the rubbing of facial glands, and spraying of   mixed with scent secreted from the anal glands. The solitary nature of the species also helps minimize territorial conflict. Nonetheless, confrontations do occur, sometimes resulting in injury and even death. The readiness of a tigress to   is announced through vocalization and scent production. There is no fixed breeding season, though the preponderance of mating appears to occur in winter, with striped cubs being born after a gestation period of more than three months. The normal litter size is two to four, though up to seven cubs have been recorded. They are born blind, and, even when their eyes open, opacity prevents clear vision for six to eight weeks. There is thus a long period of weaning, tutelage, and training during which cub mortality is high, especially if food is scarce. During this time the offspring must endure long periods of absence by the mother while she is away hunting. Weaker cubs get less food because of the aggressiveness of their stronger siblings as food is less frequently made available. The cubs remain with the mother until about the second year, when they are nearly adult and are able to kill prey for themselves. Male cubs grow more quickly than females and tend to leave their mother earlier. Though cub infanticide (mainly by males) is known, it is not very unusual to find a male with a tigress and cubs, even sharing a kill. Such associations, however, do not last long. The tigress does not breed again until her cubs are independent. The average life span of a tiger in the wild is about 11 years.

  Endangered
 Pigs, deer, rhinoceroses, and even small elephants. Tigers live in many habitats, including tropical rain forest, snow-covered coniferous and deciduous forests, mangrove swamps, and drier forest areas. Recognizing a tiger at the zoo is easy. But in their natural habitat in scattered, small areas in Asia, tigers are really hard to find. That’s because their unique orange, black, and white stripe pattern helps them blend into the forests and grassy areas where they live and hunt. Tigers are carnivores.   They are quiet, patient hunters with large powerful paws and teeth to help them catch and eat their prey. Some of their favorite meals include pigs, deer, rhinoceroses, and even small elephants. Tigers hunt for their food, but they are also hunted by humans for their valuable fur and body parts. Because of this, tiger researches think there may only be 3,500 tigers left in the world. This makes them an endangered species. Like human fingerprints, every tiger has a unique pattern of stripes that can be used to identify it!  A tiger's canine teeth are 3 inches long. A tiger’s night vision is 6 times better than a human’s. The largest species of cat in the world, tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They range across Asia from Russia all the way to the Sumatra and Indochina. Researchers still have much to learn about these beautiful, critically endangered, solitary cats.  There is currently one recognized species of tiger,  . Scientists have further classified the tiger into nine subspecies: the extinct Bali, Caspian and Javan subspecies, and the living Malayan, Sumatran, South China, Indochinese, Bengal and Amur (or Siberian) subspecies. Of these six subspecies, AZA-accredited zoos currently manage three: Amur, Malayan and Sumatran. The Smithsonian's National Zoo is home to Sumatran and Amur tigers. Tigers have reddish-orange coats with prominent black stripes, white bellies and white spots on their ears. Like a human fingerprint, no two tigers have the exact same markings. Because of this, researchers can use stripe patterns to identify different individuals when studying tigers in the wild. Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They are the largest terrestrial mammal whose diet consists entirely of meat. The tiger's closest relative is the lion. In fact, without fur, it is difficult to distinguish a tiger from a lion. Historically, tigers existed throughout much of Eastern and Southern Asia, as well as in parts of Central and Western Asia and the Middle East, surrounding the Caspian Sea. Their range has diminished significantly as human populations have expanded. It is believed they currently occupy just 7 percent of their historic range. Presently, tigers are found in a variety of habitats across South and Southeast Asia, China and Eastern Russia. They thrive in temperate, tropical or evergreen forests, mangrove swamps and grasslands. Amur tigers are primarily found in Far-East Russia, although there are small populations across the border into China and potentially North Korea. Sumatran tigers are found only on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. A tiger's range within these regions is determined by the availability of prey. Despite their solitary nature, communication is a very important part of tigers' behavioral ecology. They communicate through vocalizations, such as roaring, grunting and chuffing, and through signals, such as scent marking and scratches on trees. Tigers are fiercely territorial animals, so these signals are particularly important to communicating where one tiger's home range ends and another's begins. Tigers are solitary ambush predators that rely on stealth and strength to take down prey. These apex predators primarily hunt large ungulates, such as wild boar and deer, but are also known to consume monkeys, buffalo, sloth bears, leopards and even crocodiles. When tigers are found in close proximity to humans, they may also feed on domestic animals, such as cattle or goats. Tigers are adept swimmers and have even been recorded hunting in the wild. These powerful cats hunt primarily at night, using sight and sound to identify prey. Their striped coats help them blend into their surroundings, where they lie in wait for prey to pass by. At the opportune moment, tigers pounce on their prey, take it to the ground and finish the kill by breaking or biting the neck. Tigers hunt about once a week and consume as much as 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of food in one night. At the Zoo, tigers eat ground beef, and their diet is supplemented with enrichment items each week. They receive knucklebones or cow femurs twice a week and rabbits once a week to exercise their jaws and keep their teeth healthy. Tigers are solitary creatures, except when mating or raising young. Cubs stay with their mothers until they learn to hunt successfully, usually at about 18 to 24 months old. They reach full independence after two to three years, at which point they disperse to find their own territory. Female tigers often remain near their mother's' territory, while males disperse farther from home. Female tigers reach sexual maturity between age 3 and 4. Males are sexually mature at about 4 or 5 years old. Mating can occur at any time of year but most often takes place during cooler months between November and April. Tigers are induced ovulators, which means females will not release eggs until mating occurs. Gestation lasts approximately 100 days, and females give birth to between one and seven offspring at a time, averaging between two and four cubs. Once cubs become independent, at about age 2, females are ready to give birth again. However, if a female's offspring do not survive, due to causes such as infanticide or starvation, she is able to conceive another litter right away. The life span of tigers in the wild is usually between 10 and 15 years. In human care, or on rare occasions in the wild, a tiger can live up to 20 years. However, approximately half of all wild tiger cubs do not survive past the first two years of life. Only 40 percent of those that reach independence actually live to establish a territory and produce young. The risk of mortality remains high for adult tigers due to their territorial nature, which often results in direct competition with conspecifics, or members of the same species. Globally, tigers are considered an endangered species. Only six of the nine tiger subspecies that once existed remain, and the South China tiger is thought to be nearly or entirely extinct in the wild. The Sumatran subspecies is listed as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, and the Amur is listed as endangered. All tigers are protected under CITES Appendix I. It is generously estimated that only 3,900 tigers exist in the wild, including approximately 200 to 400 Sumatran tigers and 360 Amur tigers. The Smithsonian's National Zoo participates in the Species Survival Plan for Sumatran and Amur tigers, which works to responsibly breed and manage tiger populations within AZA-accredited institutions throughout North America. The goal of the SSP is to sustain a population of the three manage tiger subspecies—Amur, Sumatran and Malayan—that is genetically healthy enough to maintain a high genetic diversity for the next 100 years. There are numerous threats to tiger survival, including human-animal conflict driven by human overpopulation, poaching for use in traditional medicines and the destruction and fragmentation of habitat. Human-animal conflict stems from two primary issues. The first is a rise in agriculture and overgrazing by farmers, which drives away typical prey for tigers and forces them to hunt livestock. The second is urban sprawl and the encroachment of towns and cities into tiger territories, which displaces the cats and leads to killing by humans provoked by fear. These conflicts are not unique to Asia and are common as humans encroach upon the territory of large predators around the world. In the U.S., cougars in the western parts of the country have faced similar threats. The demand for tiger bones and other body parts used in traditional Asian medicines is also contributing to the tiger's decline. Despite the work of many governments and scientists to decrease demand by educating the public about other sources for these "medical" compounds, an illegal market for tiger parts persists. In some areas, tiger farming has become a profitable illicit market. For decades, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute scientists have studied tigers to understand their behavioral ecology and the most effective ways to protect them. They support efforts to stop poaching and trafficking, reduce human-tiger conflict, improve management practices in tiger habitats and protect Asian forests where tigers live. In collaboration with USAID and local partners in Bangladesh, SCBI scientists are collecting and analyzing a wide range of field data on tigers, prey and mangrove habitat, including through camera-trap studies to estimate tiger populations. To support and assist management of this project, rangers are trained and given equipment to patrol the forest to prevent poaching and mitigate human-animal conflict. Smithsonian efforts to save tigers began in 1972 with the Smithsonian-Nepal Tiger Ecology Project. In the 1990s scientists began approaching tiger conservation as a complex problem stretching across borders, requiring the cooperation of many partners. In 2008, the Smithsonian Institution joined the World Bank Group and the Global Environmental Facility to launch the Global Tiger Initiative, designed to stabilize and restore wild tiger populations to save the species from extinction. As a member of the GTI, SCBI scientists work with policy makers and practitioners across Asia and around the world to save tigers. At the Tiger Summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2010, leaders of 13 tiger-range countries met with international science and conservation experts, including SCBI scientists, to do what had never been done before: create a comprehensive strategy to save tigers. At the Summit, they adopted the first-of-its-kind Global Tiger Recovery Program (GTRP). Simultaneously, SCBI staff worked with individual countries to develop National Tiger Recovery Priorities. .p As part of the GTRP, the Smithsonian prepared a Global Support Program in Capacity Building and Knowledge Sharing through regional training programs in Asia and Core Learning Programs on conservation best practices. They have held courses and workshops for frontline practitioners in protected tiger-range areas, training hundreds of rangers, foresters and habitat managers to adopt the latest conservation and Spatial Monitoring and Report Tool (SMART) patrolling practices, with a focus on preserving and increasing wild tiger populations. SMART patrol training courses have been held in Thailand, Nepal, Indonesia and Malaysia. Using state-of-the-art techniques, the training has helped create more effective measures against wildlife poaching and the illegal trade and trafficking of live tigers and tiger parts. Today, follow up projects like SCBI’s Tiger Conservation Partnership Program help Malaysia share information with its neighbors about effective ways to identify and protect tiger habitats in the face of rapid infrastructure development. Its knowledge exchange platform, WildTigers Listserv, has more than 500 tiger conservation professionals as members. There is still much to be done to protect tigers from going extinct. Their future relies heavily on the protection of habitat within their range, which overlaps with areas of significant and continued human population growth. Continued partnerships between governments, conservation organizations and communities will be essential to the long-term protection of this species. The Smithsonian's National Zoo has two Amur tigers, a male named Pavel and a female named Nikita, and one Sumatran tiger, a female named Damai. Damai gave birth to a male Sumatran tiger cub on July 11, 2017. The cub was later  , where he currently lives and thrives with another young male tiger cub. Nikita came to the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in 2019 from the Bronx Zoo in New York as part of a breeding recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ Species Survival Plan. Pavel arrived at the Zoo in 2017 from the Lincoln Park Zoo in Illinois.  General Info |  Smithsonian’s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute 3001 Connecticut Ave., NW Washington, DC 20008 PO Box 37012 We   need your support. Donate to the National Zoo Emergency Fund. After a century of decline, overall wild tiger numbers are starting to tick upward. Based on the best available information, tiger populations are stable or increasing in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Russia and China. An estimated 3,900 tigers remain in the wild, but much more work is needed to protect this species if we are to secure its future in the wild. In some areas, including much of Southeast Asia, tigers are still in crisis and declining in number. Map data provided by  There are two recognized subspecies of tiger*: the continental ( ) and the Sunda ( ). The largest of all the Asian big cats, tigers rely primarily on sight and sound rather than smell for hunting. They typically hunt alone and stalk prey. A tiger can consume more than 80 pounds of meat at one time. On average, tigers give birth to two to four cubs every two years. If all the cubs in one litter die, a second litter may be produced within five months. Tigers generally gain independence at around two years of age and attain sexual maturity at age three or four for females and four or five years for males. Juvenile mortality is high, however—about half of all cubs do not survive more than two years. Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild. Males of the larger subspecies, the continental tiger, may weigh up to 660 pounds. For males of the smaller subspecies—the Sunda tiger—the upper range is at around 310 pounds. Within both subspecies, males are heavier than females. Tigers are mostly solitary, apart from associations between mother and offspring. Individual tigers have a large territory, and the size is determined mostly by the availability of prey. Individuals mark their domain with urine, feces, rakes, scrapes, and vocalizing. Across their range, tigers face unrelenting pressures from poaching, retaliatory killings, and habitat loss. They are forced to compete for space with dense and often growing human populations. Illegal snaring is a rampant threat to wildlife and people in the forests of Southeast Asia. Snares are used to capture animals for the illegal wildlife trade. WWF-supported ranger patrols are working to address this crisis by removing snares.  This big cat is a critical part of ecosystems and cultures. If forests are emptied of every last tiger, all that will remain are distant legends and zoo sightings. The tiger has evolved over millions of years. Currently, this big cat is being trapped, its parts trafficked for various purposes, and pushed out of its home. Many that are left in the wild cling to survival in isolated patches of forest scattered across Asia. To save tigers, we need to secure forest and grassland habitats across Asia where they live. By protecting large, biologically diverse landscapes, we allow tigers to roam and preserve the many other threatened species that live there. To protect just one tiger, we have to conserve an estimated 10,000 hectares of forest. As a large predator, the tiger plays a key role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. These ecosystems supply both nature and people with fresh water, food, and health. Securing tiger landscapes could help protect at least nine major watersheds, which regulate and provide freshwater for over 800 million people in Asia.   Tigers can directly help some of the world’s poorest communities. Tourists go to some places where tigers exist, creating opportunities for communities with few alternatives to earn money. Tiger conservation projects also help provide alternative livelihoods for rural communities, helping to bring in income and generating employment opportunities. No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died Known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalised population Facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the Wild Facing a high risk of extinction in the Wild Facing a high risk of extinction in the Wild Likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future Does not qualify for Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, or Near Threatened Poaching is the most immediate threat to wild tigers. Every part of the tiger—from whisker to tail—has been found in illegal wildlife markets. A result of persistent demand, their bones, and other body parts are used for modern health tonics and folk remedies, and their skins are sought after as status symbols among some Asian cultures. There are often limited resources for guarding protected areas in the countries where tigers live. Even countries with strong enforcement of tiger protection laws continue to fight a never-ending battle against poaching, which is now often orchestrated by transnational crime syndicates that rake in significant profits from wildlife crime and undermine the security of local communities. The impact from the death of a single tiger at the hands of poachers reaches beyond one single loss. If a female tiger with cubs is killed, her cubs will most likely die without their mother, and the female's potential for future breeding is lost. If a male is killed, his death can result in intense competition for his territory among surviving males in the population, leading to potential injury and death. Tigers have lost an estimated 95% of their historical range. Their habitat has been destroyed, degraded, and fragmented by human activities. The clearing of forests for agriculture and timber, as well as the building of road networks and other development activities, pose serious threats to tiger habitats. Tigers need wide swaths of habitat for their survival since they have large home ranges and are very territorial. Fewer tigers can survive in small, scattered islands of habitat, which leads to a higher risk of inbreeding and makes tigers more vulnerable to poaching as they venture beyond protected areas to establish their territories. This underscores the need to ensure habitat connectivity between the protected areas where tigers live. People and tigers increasingly compete for space. As forests shrink and prey becomes scarce, tigers are forced to leave protected areas in search of food and to establish territories. This takes them into human-dominated areas that lie between habitat fragments, where they can hunt domestic livestock that many local communities depend on for their livelihood. In retaliation, tigers are sometimes killed or captured. “Conflict” tigers can end up for sale in black markets. Local community dependence on forests for fuel wood, food, and timber heightens the risk of tiger attacks on people. One of the world’s largest, and most uniquely-adapted, tiger populations are found in the Sundarbans—a large mangrove forest area shared by India and Bangladesh on the coast of the Indian Ocean. It is also the only coastal mangrove tiger habitat in the world. These mangrove forests harbor a variety of species, including tigers, and protect coastal regions from storm surges and wind damage. However, rising sea levels caused by climate change threaten to wipe out these forests and the last remaining habitat of this tiger population. According to a WWF study, without mitigation efforts, projected sea-level rise—about a foot by 2070—could destroy nearly the entire Sundarbans tiger habitat. Current estimates indicate that there are more than 8,000 tigers being held in more than 200 centers in East and Southeast Asia, with roughly three-quarters of these tigers located in China. The current scale of commercial captive breeding efforts within these farms is a significant obstacle to the recovery and protection of wild tiger populations because they perpetuate the demand for tiger products, serve as a cover for illegal trade and undermine enforcement efforts. WWF is engaging with governments in countries with active tiger farms, and advocates ending breeding and phasing out the farms. WWF also advocates for improved regulation of the   It is estimated that approximately 5,000 tigers reside in the US, and we must ensure that these animals are not exploited by, or contributing to, the illegal trade in tigers and their parts. As demonstrated in a number of areas, wild tigers can recover. In 2010, the 13 tiger range countries committed to TX2—doubling wild tiger numbers by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger. In pursuing TX2, WWF and its partners have taken a comprehensive approach to tiger conservation. WWF works to enforce zero tolerance for tiger poaching across Asia. We help build the capacity of government enforcement units in each landscape and install the best new technologies to assist local agencies by achieving conservation results. We help improve the effectiveness of wildlife rangers by training personnel from enforcement agencies on tools such as SMART (Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool). We also work to ensure that communities have a stake in conservation, as they are typically the best stewards and managers of their natural resources. Tigers need secure areas to thrive, and our work to protect and connect their fragile habitat is based on rigorous scientific analysis. WWF has chosen places to focus its resources based on the best available science and where tigers have the best chance of recovery and long-term persistence. The locations encompass tiger corridors that link tiger sites within landscapes. Our work includes building local capacity to manage protected areas, coordinating with partners to manage core tiger areas and corridors, and addressing human-wildlife conflict and the impacts of infrastructure development in tiger landscapes. To ensure effective conservation management of tiger sites, the Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CA|TS) provide a minimum set of standards to encourage the long-term success of tiger conservation and best practices in these areas. Nine of the 13 tiger range countries are currently implementing CA|TS or in discussions on registering, and two sites have achieved CA|TS approval by meeting all the required standards. Monitoring tigers and their prey is essential to achieving our goal of doubling wild tiger populations. By employing camera traps, tracking technologies and DNA collected from scat (droppings), we analyze the progress of tiger populations in order to adapt our strategies and make conservation decisions based on strong science and field experience. WWF works with governments across the 13 tiger range countries with wild tiger populations to build and maintain momentum around the conservation of tigers, which is an asset that can enhance their development agendas. By linking tiger conservation with forest preservation and carbon sequestration efforts, tiger range nations and their partners can demonstrate their commitment to promoting a healthy environmental and economic future. Trade in tiger parts and products is a major threat to wild tiger survival. Together with TRAFFIC, the global wildlife trade monitoring network, we implement strategies to help governments stop wildlife criminal networks, shut down black markets and change consumer behavior. We conduct investigations to document the tiger trade, catalyze action against it and help train enforcement agencies. We continue to build strategies to reduce demand for tiger parts and products and shut down tiger “farms”. Forests in Asia, home to elephants, tigers and other endangered species—are often cleared to make room for growing rubber trees. They are among the most threatened forests in the world. That’s why WWF has set an ambitious goal of transforming the global rubber market. Tiger ‘farms’ are captive facilities that breed tigers to supply or directly engage in the commercial trade of tiger parts or products. WWF is calling for greater oversight and protection of all captive tigers. Ask your member of Congress to ensure laws are in place to protect tigers from illegal wildlife trade. Make a symbolic tiger adoption to help save some of the world's most endangered animals from extinction and support WWF's conservation efforts.

 There are only around 3,900 tigers in the wild. With the support of Tiger Protectors around the world, they are beginning to make a comeback.

                                                                    Illegal wildlife trade

But here’s the shocking truth. Wild tiger numbers dropped by more than 95% since the beginning of the 20th century. Now, for the first time in conservation history, their numbers are on the increase. We aim to help double the number of wild tigers to over 6,000 by 2022 – the next Chinese year of the tiger. In recent years, conservation work and the commitment of various governments has halted the decline in global tiger numbers. But there’s a lot more work to do. We’re working closely with governments and community groups across Asia – and your support is crucial, as always. Will you join us and help protect this amazing wild cat? "I am proud to be engaged in supporting our work on tigers, at such an unprecedented and exciting time in history where wild tiger numbers are starting to increase globally. In my lifetime, tiger populations declined, but are now on the up. That’s quite incredible. However, the threats remain, and we need to do all we can to help achieve the very ambitious goal of doubling the number of tigers in the wild by 2022 – a goal which was set in 2010 when the wild tiger population was at an all-time low." 
 Tigers used to roam across most of Asia, but now they’re restricted to just 7% of their original range, in isolated forests and grasslands across 13 countries. 
 As top predators, tigers help to keep their environment healthy. It’s the way things naturally work in the wild – the predators prey on other animals, in this case herbivores (plant-eaters) such as deer. But without enough tigers to eat them, herbivores can overgraze and damage the land, disrupting the balance of the local environment.  Local people also depend on a healthy environment for food, water and lots of other resources. By helping protect tigers we’re also helping look after the places where they live, which is good for all the people and wildlife sharing that environment. 
    
                                “Tigers are powerful, they are beautiful, they are perfect… and they can coexist with humans.”

Pavel Fomenko is a Tiger Protector in Russia. He knows the forests of the Russian Far East like the back of his hand, and uses this knowledge to help protect the endangered Amur tiger. 

It’s a lonely and dangerous job. Pavel has been known to spend 40 days in a row alone in the wilderness, where temperatures drop well below -30C in winter months. 

Pavel is a passionate and talented conservationist . His work involves supporting a complex system of tiger protection involving tracking poachers, performing forensics on animal remains and monitoring tiger numbers in the Russian Far East. Tiger Protectors like Pavel are a key part of the efforts that have seen wild tiger numbers begin to rise globally. 

                             
                                “My parents and husband are my tower of strength. They think my job is very special and unique for a woman, but at the same time they’re worried sick about my safety when I’m in the field.”

Singye Wangmo is one of only a few female forestry officers working in Bhutan. Her role requires her to leave her husband, parents and pets at home while she spends weeks working in the field protecting around 30 wild tigers and other wildlife that live in Bhutan’s Royal Manas National Park.

Leading a team of 30 rangers, Singye’s job involves the monitoring of tigers through camera traps, 
conducting surveys on foot and patrolling known poaching hotspots. Poaching groups often venture in to the park, but Singye is determined to continue the work she has been doing for 3 years: “The fight to save tigers is our collective responsibility. Human beings are the answer to saving tigers. You and I are the answer.”

                             
                                “We’re not going to lose tigers. Let’s stay positive.”

Ollie, tiger protector and committed conservationist, devotes his free time and energy to raising funds to protect tigers. Ollie first ran for charity in 2013, when he and his fiancé raised £600 for tigers by running the Edinburgh Rock ‘n’ Roll half marathon. 

Last year he covered over 500 miles running both the London and Paris marathons, and completing a Richmond Park duathlon. This served as perfect training for the Royal Parks Foundation half marathon, in which he donned a tiger onesie and raised £350.

     A female tiger gives birth to a litter of three or four cubs, who she will care for until they are a year-and-a-half old. These cubs quadruple in size during their first month! The powerful predator generally hunts alone, able to bring down prey such as deer and antelope. Tigers wait until dark to hunt. The tiger sprints to an unsuspecting animal, usually pulling it off its feet with its teeth and claws. If the prey animal is large, the   bites its throat to kill it; smaller prey is usually killed when the tiger breaks its neck. Tigers have been known to eat up to 60 pounds of meat in one night, but more often they consume about 12 pounds during a meal. It may take days for a   to finish eating its kill. The cat eats until it's full, and then covers the carcass with leaves and dirt. The tiger comes back to feed some more. Tigers live far apart from each other. A tiger knows if it is in another tiger’s territory based on the trees around him. Each tiger marks the trees in its area with urine and special scratches. Unlike most members of the cat family, tigers seem to enjoy water and  . Some tigers live where it gets very cold—in   and parts of southeast Asia. The whole species is endangered throughout its range. Tigers have been overhunted for their fur as well as for other body parts that many people use in traditional medicines. Tigers' habitat has also dwindled seriously as humans have developed land for uses such as farming and logging. However, in the Siberian region of  , there’s hope that these big cats are  . Because of their size, strength, and predatory skills, tigers are considered one of the    ,  ,  , and   are also part of this grouping. Tiger stripes are special to each individual, and their tails help them to keep their balance. The big cats share all but 4.4% of their DNA with  . Take the   to see how much you know about these fierce felines. Then, just for fun, see which wild cat you’re most like with our  . 
 The   ( ) is the largest       and a member of the    . It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an  , primarily preying on   such as   and  . It is territorial and generally a   predator, requiring large contiguous areas of  , which support its requirements for   and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's   to establish their own.
 The tiger once ranged widely from the   in the west to the   basin, and in the south from the foothills of the   to   in the  . Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in   and  , from the islands of   and Bali, and in large areas of   and   and  . Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from     to subtropical and   on the   and  . 
 The tiger is listed as   on the  . As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline include  ,   and  . This, coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more   on  , has caused significant  .
 The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's  . It featured prominently in ancient   and   and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many  ,   and as   for sporting teams. The tiger is the   of  ,  ,   and  .
 The     and     derive from Old French  , from    . 
This was a borrowing of   τίγρις 'tigris', a foreign borrowing of unknown origin meaning 'tiger' as well as the river  . 
The origin may have been the   word   meaning 'pointed or sharp', and the   word   'arrow', perhaps referring to the speed of the tiger's leap, although these words are not known to have any meanings associated with tigers. 
 The generic name   is derived from the   word  , and the   word πάνθηρ 'panther'. 
The   word पाण्डर pāṇḍ-ara means 'pale yellow, whitish, white'. 
 In 1758,   described the tiger in his work   and gave it the    .  In 1929, the British taxonomist   subordinated the species under the genus   using the scientific name  . 
 Following Linnaeus's first descriptions of the species, several tiger   were described and proposed as  .  The   of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999. Most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence characteristics that vary widely within populations.  , tigers from different regions vary little, and   between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the  . Therefore, it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely   in mainland Asia, and   in the  . 
 Results of   analysis of 111 tiger skulls from Southeast Asian range countries indicate that Sumatran tiger skulls differ from Indochinese and Javan tiger skulls, whereas Bali tiger skulls are similar in size to Javan tiger skulls. The authors proposed to classify Sumatran and Javan tiger as distinct species,   and   with Bali tiger as subspecies  . 
 In 2015, morphological, ecological and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction of the two evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely   comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and   comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management. The     constitutes two  : 
 One conservation specialist welcomed this proposal as it would make captive breeding programmes and future rewilding of zoo-born tigers easier. One   was sceptical of this study and maintained that the currently recognised nine subspecies can be distinguished genetically. 
 In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the   revised felid taxonomy and recognized the tiger populations in continental Asia as  , and those in the Sunda Islands as  . 
The following tables are based on the   of the species   provided in  .  It also reflects the classification used by the Cat Classification Task Force in 2017:
 A study published in 2018 was based on 32 tiger specimens using the   approach for analysis. Results support six   tiger   corresponding with the living subspecies and indicate that the most recent   lived about 110,000 years ago. 
 The tiger's closest living relatives were previously thought to be the   species  ,   and  . Results of   indicate that about 2.88 million years ago, the tiger and the     diverged from the other   species, and that both may be more closely related to each other than to the lion, leopard and jaguar. 
The geographic origin of the   is most likely northern Central Asia or the   region. The tiger–snow leopard lineage dispersed in Southeast Asia during the  . 
  is considered to be a   of the modern tiger. It lived at the beginning of the   about two million years ago, its   remains were   in   of northwestern China. It was smaller and more " ", but functionally and ecologically similar to the modern tiger. It is disputed as to whether it had the striping pattern. Northwestern China is thought to be the origin of the tiger lineage. Tigers grew in size, possibly in response to   of prey species like   and  , which may have occurred in Southeast Asia during the  .

Tigers reached India and northern Asia in the late Pleistocene, reaching eastern  ,  , and  . Some fossil skulls are morphologically distinct from lion skulls, which could indicate tiger presence in Alaska during the  , about 100,000 years ago. 
 In the    , two articulated   were found amidst an assemblage of other animal bones and stone tools in   near the village of New Ibajay. They were smaller than mainland tiger fossils, possibly due to  . Otherwise, it would appear that early humans had accumulated the bones,  so it may be that the tiger parts were imported from elsewhere, or that the tiger colonised Palawan from Borneo before the Holocene, considering the proximity of the two islands.  Fossil remains of tigers were also excavated in Sri Lanka, China,   and   (Malaysia) dating to the late  ,   and Early  .  The   was apparently present in Borneo between the   and the Holocene, but whether it went extinct in prehistoric or recent times has not been resolved. 
 The potential tiger range during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene was predicted applying   based on more than 500 tiger locality records combined with   data. The resulting model shows a contiguous tiger range from southern India to Siberia at the  , indicating an unobstructed   between tiger populations in mainland Asia throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The tiger populations on the Sunda Islands and mainland Asia were possibly separated during  .  Results of a   study indicate that all living tigers had a common ancestor 72,000–108,000 years ago.  The tiger's full   sequence was published in 2013. It was found to have similar repeat composition to other cat genomes and an appreciably conserved  . 
 Captive tigers were bred with lions to create   called liger and tigon. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species. Breeding hybrids is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conservation. 
The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress. Ligers are typically between 10 and 12 ft (3.0 and 3.7 m) in length, and weigh between 800 and 1,000 lb (360 and 450 kg) or more.  Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species. 
 The less common tigon is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger.  Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene, tigons are around the same size as their parents.  Some females are fertile and have occasionally given birth to   when mated to a male  . 
 The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of its body. Its   is dense and heavy, and   varies between shades of orange and brown with white   areas and distinctive vertical black stripes that are unique in each individual.  Stripes are likely advantageous for   in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade.  The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns and   are the more common camouflage pattern among felids.  The orangish colour may also aid in camouflage as the tiger's prey are  , and thus may perceive the cat as green and blended in with the vegetation.  A tiger's coat pattern is still visible when it is  . This is not due to skin pigmentation, but to the stubble and   embedded in the skin, similar to human beards (colloquially  ), and is in common with other big cats.  They have a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. The   are circular with yellow  . The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black.  These spots are thought to play an important role in   communication. 
 The tiger's   is similar to a  's skull, with the frontal region usually less depressed or flattened, and a slightly longer   region. The lion skull shows broader   openings. Due to the variation in skull sizes of the two species, the structure of the lower jaw is a reliable indicator for their identification.  The tiger has fairly stout teeth; its somewhat curved   are the longest among living felids with a   height of up to 90 mm (3.5 in). 
 There is a notable   between male and female tigers, with the latter being consistently smaller. The size difference between them is proportionally greater in the large tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females. Males also have wider forepaw pads, enabling sex to be identified from tracks.  It has been   that body size of different tiger populations may be correlated with climate and be explained by   and  , or by distribution and size of available prey species. 
 Generally, males vary in total length from 250 to 390 cm (8.2 to 12.8 ft) and weigh between 90 and 300 kg (200 and 660 lb) with skull length ranging from 316 to 383 mm (12.4 to 15.1 in). Females vary in total length from 200 to 275 cm (6.56 to 9.02 ft), weigh 65 to 167 kg (143 to 368 lb) with skull length ranging from 268 to 318 mm (0.879 to 1.043 ft). In either sex, the tail represents about 0.6 to 1.1 m (24 to 43 in) of the total length. The Bengal and Siberian tigers are amongst the tallest cats in shoulder height. They are also ranked among the biggest cats that have ever existed reaching weights of more than 300 kg (660 lb).  The tigers of the Sunda islands are smaller and less heavy than tigers in mainland Asia, rarely exceeding 142 kg (313 lb) in weight. 
 There are three colour variants — white, golden and stripeless snow white — that now rarely occur in the wild due to the reduction of wild tiger populations, but continue in captive populations. The   has white fur and sepia brown stripes. The   has a pale golden pelage with a blond tone and reddish-brown stripes. The snow white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale reddish-brown ringed tail.  Both snow white and golden tigers are homozygous for    .  A   is a colour variant due to pseudo- . They have thick stripes close together so that the background colour is barely visible between stripes. 
 The white tiger lacks   (which creates the orange colour), and has dark sepia-brown stripes and blue eyes. This altered pigmentation is caused by a   gene that is inherited as an   trait, which is determined by a white  . It is not an  , as the   are scarcely affected.  The mutation changes a single   in the transporter protein  . Both parents need to have the   for whiteness to have white cubs. 
Between the early and mid 20th century, white tigers were recorded and shot in the Indian states of  ,  ,   and in the area of  . The local maharaja started breeding tigers in the early 1950s and kept a white male tiger together with its normal-coloured daughter; they had white cubs. 
To preserve this recessive trait, only a few white individuals were used in captive breeding, which led to a high degree of  .   is the main reason for many health problems of captive white tigers, including  ,  ,   and premature death. 
Other physical defects include   and  . 
 The Tiger   has condemned the breeding of white tigers, alleging they are of mixed ancestry and of unknown lineage. The   responsible for white colouration are represented by 0.001% of the population. The disproportionate growth in numbers of white tigers points to   among     individuals. This would lead to   and loss of  . 
 The tiger historically ranged from eastern   and   to the coast of the  , and from   across   to the Indonesian islands of  ,   and  .  Since the end of the  , it was probably restricted by periods of deep snow lasting longer than six months.  Currently, it occurs in less than 6% of its historical range, as it has been extirpated from   and  , large parts of Southeast and  . It now mainly occurs in the  , the  , Sumatra and the  . In China and Myanmar, breeding populations appear to rely on immigration from neighbouring countries while its status in the   is unknown. 
 The tiger is essentially associated with   habitats.  Tiger populations thrive where populations of wild  ,   and suids are stable. 
Records in Central Asia indicate that it occurred foremost in   riverine forests along the  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   and their tributaries. In the Caucasus, it inhabited hilly and lowland forests. 
Historical records in   are known only from the southern coast of the   and adjacent  .  In the  -  region, it inhabits   and  , where   provide food and water, and serve as dispersal corridors for both tiger and ungulates. 
On the Indian subcontinent, it inhabits mainly  , moist  ,   and the   of the  .  In the  , tigers were documented in   up to an elevation of 3,630 m (11,910 ft).  In Thailand, it lives in deciduous and evergreen forests.  In Laos, 14 tigers were documented in semi-evergreen and evergreen forest interspersed with grassland in   National Protected Area during surveys from 2013 to 2017.  In Sumatra, tiger populations range from lowland   to rugged montane forests. 
 When not subject to human disturbance, the tiger is mainly  .  It does not often climb trees but cases have been recorded.  It is a strong swimmer and often bathes in ponds, lakes and rivers, thus keeping cool in the heat of the day.  Individuals can cross rivers up to 7 km (4.3 mi) wide and can swim up to 29 km (18 mi) in a day.  During the 1980s, a tiger was observed frequently hunting prey through deep lake water in  . 
 The tiger is a long-ranging species, and individuals disperse over distances of up to 650 km (400 mi) to reach tiger populations in other areas.    tigers in   started   from their natal areas earliest at the age of 19 months. Four females dispersed between 0 and 43.2 km (0.0 and 26.8 mi), and 10 males between 9.5 and 65.7 km (5.9 and 40.8 mi). None of them crossed open cultivated areas that were more than 10 km (6.2 mi) wide, but moved through forested habitat. 
 Adult tigers lead largely solitary lives. They establish and maintain   but have much wider home ranges within which they roam. Resident adults of either sex generally confine their movements to their home ranges, within which they satisfy their needs and those of their growing cubs. Individuals sharing the same area are aware of each other's movements and activities.  The size of the home range mainly depends on prey abundance, geographic area and sex of the individual.  In India, home ranges appear to be 50 to 1,000 km  (19 to 386 sq mi) while in Manchuria, they range from 500 to 4,000 km  (190 to 1,540 sq mi). In Nepal, defended territories are recorded to be 19 to 151 km  (7.3 to 58.3 sq mi) for males and 10 to 51 km  (3.9 to 19.7 sq mi) for females. 
 Young female tigers establish their first territories close to their mother's. The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time. Males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out at a younger age to  . A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers. 
 To identify his territory, the male marks trees by   and   secretions, as well as marking trails with   and marking trees or the ground with their claws. Females also use these "scrapes", as well as urine and scat markings. Scent markings of this type allow an individual to pick up information on another's identity, sex and reproductive status. Females in   will signal their availability by scent marking more frequently and increasing their vocalisations. 
 Although for the most part avoiding each other, tigers are not always territorial and relationships between individuals can be complex. An adult of either sex will sometimes share its kill with others, even those who may not be related to them.   observed a male share a kill with two females and four cubs. Unlike male lions, male tigers allow females and cubs to feed on the kill before the male is finished with it; all involved generally seem to behave amicably, in contrast to the competitive behaviour shown by a lion pride.  Stephen Mills described a social feeding event in Ranthambhore National Park:
 A   tigress they called Padmini killed a 250 kg (550 lb) male   – a very large antelope. They found her at the kill just after dawn with her three 14-month-old cubs, and they watched uninterrupted for the next ten hours. During this period the family was joined by two adult females and one adult male, all offspring from Padmini's previous litters, and by two unrelated tigers, one female the other unidentified. By three o'clock there were no fewer than nine tigers round the kill. Occasionally, male tigers participate in raising cubs, usually their own, but this is extremely rare and not always well understood. In May 2015, Amur tigers were photographed by camera traps in the Sikhote-Alin Bioshpere Reserve. The photos show a male Amur tiger pass by, followed by a female and three cubs within the span of about two minutes. 
In Ranthambore, a male Bengal tiger raised and defended two orphaned female cubs after their mother had died of illness. The cubs remained under his care, he supplied them with food, protected them from his rival and sister, and apparently also trained them. 
 Male tigers are generally more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture.  Once   has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, as long as they do not live in too close quarters.  The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and sometimes resulted in the death of one of the males. 
 Facial expressions include the "defense threat", where an individual bares its teeth, flattens its ears and its pupils enlarge. Both males and females show a  , a characteristic grimace, when sniffing urine markings, but flehmen is more often associated with males detecting the markings made by tigresses in oestrus. Like other  , tigers  , particularly in aggressive situations, during the mating season or when making a kill. There are two different roars: the "true" roar is made using the   and forced through an open mouth as it progressively closes, and the shorter, harsher "coughing" roar is made with the mouth open and teeth exposed. The "true" roar can be heard at up to 3 km (1.9 mi) away and is sometimes emitted three or four times in succession. When tense, tigers will moan, a sound similar to a roar but more subdued and made when the mouth is partially or completely closed. Moaning can be heard 400 m (1,300 ft) away.   —soft, low-frequency snorting similar to   in smaller cats—is heard in more friendly situations.  Other vocal communications include grunts, woofs, snarls, miaows, hisses and growls. 
 In the wild, tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized mammals, particularly   weighing 60–250 kg (130–550 lb). Range-wide,  ,  ,   and   are significantly preferred. Tigers are capable of taking down larger prey like adult   but will also opportunistically eat much smaller prey, such as  ,   and other ground-based  ,  ,  , and  .  They also prey on other predators, including dogs, leopards, pythons, bears, and crocodiles.  Tigers generally do not prey on fully grown adult   and   but incidents have been reported.  More often, it is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken.  When in close proximity to humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as  ,  , and  . Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for   such as fruit of the  . 
 Tigers are thought to be mainly   predators,  but in areas where humans are absent, remote-controlled, hidden   recorded them hunting in daylight.  They generally hunt alone and ambush their prey as most other cats do, overpowering them from any angle, using their body size and strength to knock the prey off balance. Successful hunts usually require the tiger to almost simultaneously leap onto its quarry, knock it over, and grab the throat or nape with its teeth.  Despite their large size, tigers can reach speeds of about 49–65 km/h (30–40 mph) but only in short bursts; consequently, tigers must be close to their prey before they break cover. If the prey catches wind of the tiger's presence before this, the tiger usually abandons the hunt rather than chase prey or battle it head-on. Horizontal leaps of up to 10 m (33 ft) have been reported, although leaps of around half this distance are more typical. One in 2 to 20 hunts, including stalking near potential prey, ends in a successful kill. 
 When hunting larger animals, tigers prefer to bite the throat and use their powerful forelimbs to hold onto the prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of  .  By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much.  Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species.  Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on its own. 
 With smaller prey, such as monkeys and hares, the tiger bites the  , often breaking the  , piercing the  , or severing the   or  .  Though rarely observed, some tigers have been recorded to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle,  and break the backs of  . 
 After killing their prey, tigers sometimes drag it to conceal it in vegetative cover, usually pulling it by grasping with their mouths at the site of the killing bite. This, too, can require great physical strength. In one case, after it had killed an adult gaur, a tiger was observed to drag the massive carcass over a distance of 12 m (39 ft). When 13 men simultaneously tried to drag the same carcass later, they were unable to move it.  An adult tiger can go for up to two weeks without eating, then gorge on 34 kg (75 lb) of flesh at one time. In captivity, adult tigers are fed 3 to 6 kg (6.6 to 13.2 lb) of meat a day. 
 Tigers usually prefer to eat prey they have caught themselves, but may eat carrion in times of scarcity and may even   prey from other large carnivores. Although predators typically avoid one another, if a prey item is under dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common. If these are not sufficient, the conflicts may turn violent; tigers may kill competitors as  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and   on occasion. Tigers may also prey on these competitors.  Attacks on smaller predators, such as  ,  , and  , are almost certainly predatory.  Crocodiles, bears, and large packs of dholes may win conflicts against tigers and, in the cases of crocodiles and bears, even can kill them. 
 The considerably smaller   avoids competition from tigers by hunting at different times of the day and hunting different prey.  In India's  , most prey selected by leopards were from 30 to 175 kg (66 to 386 lb) against a preference for prey weighing over 176 kg (388 lb) in the tigers. The average prey weight in the two respective big cats in India was 37.6 kg (83 lb) against 91.5 kg (202 lb).  With relatively abundant prey, tigers and leopards were seen to successfully coexist without competitive exclusion or interspecies   hierarchies that may be more common to the   savanna, where the leopard exists with the lion.    may feed on the tiger's kills.  Tigers appear to inhabit the deep parts of a forest while smaller predators like leopards and dholes are pushed closer to the fringes. 
 The tiger   all year round, but most cubs are born between March and June, with a second peak in September.   ranges from 93 to 114 days, with an average of 103 to 105 days. A female is only receptive for three to six days.  Mating is frequent and noisy during that time.  The female gives birth in a sheltered location such as in tall grass, in a dense thicket, cave or rocky crevice. The father generally takes no part in rearing.  Litters consist of two or three cubs, rarely as many as six. Cubs weigh from 780 to 1,600 g (1.72 to 3.53 lb) each at birth, and are born with eyes closed. They open their eyes when they are six to 14 days old.  Their   break through at the age of about two weeks. They start to eat meat at the age of eight weeks. At around this time, females usually shift them to a new den.  They make short ventures with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older.  Females lactate for five to six months.  Around the time they are weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and are taught how to hunt. 
 A   cub emerges in most litters, usually a male. The dominant cub is more active than its siblings and takes the lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier.  The cubs start hunting on their own earliest at the age of 11 months, and become independent around 18 to 20 months of age.  They separate from their mother at the age of two to two and a half years, but continue to grow until the age of five years.  Young females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males at four to five years.  Unrelated wandering male tigers often kill cubs to make the female receptive, since the tigress may give birth to another litter within five months if the cubs of the previous litter are lost. The mortality rate of tiger cubs is about 50% in the first two years. Few other predators attack tiger cubs due to the diligence and ferocity of the mother. Apart from humans and other tigers, common causes of cub mortality are starvation, freezing, and accidents.    of the tiger is about eight years. 
The oldest recorded captive tiger lived for 26 years.

 In the 1990s, a new approach to tiger conservation was developed: Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), which are blocks of habitat that have the potential to host tiger populations in 15 habitat types within five  . Altogether 143 TCUs were identified and prioritized based on size and integrity of habitat, poaching pressure and population status. They range in size from 33 to 155,829 km  (13 to 60,166 sq mi). 
 In 2016, an estimate of a global wild tiger population of approximately 3,890 individuals was presented during the Third Asia Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation.  The   subsequently declared that the world's count of wild tigers had risen for the first time in a century. 
 Major threats to the tiger include  ,   and   for fur and body parts, which have simultaneously greatly reduced tiger populations in the wild.  In India, only 11% of the historical tiger habitat remains due to habitat fragmentation.  Demand for tiger parts for use in   has also been cited as a major threat to tiger populations.  Some estimates suggest that there are fewer than 2,500 mature breeding individuals, with no subpopulation containing more than 250 mature breeding individuals.  The global wild tiger population was estimated by the   at 3,200 in 2011 and 3,890 in 2015—  reported that this was the first increase in a century. 
 India is home to the world's largest population of wild tigers.  A 2014 census estimated a population of 2,226, a 30% increase since 2011.  On   2019, the 'Tiger Estimation Report 2018’ was released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The report estimates a population of 2967 tigers in India with 25% increase since 2014. Modi said "India is one of the safest habitats for tigers as it has achieved the target of doubling the tiger population from 1411 in 2011 to 2967 in 2019". 
 In 1973, India's  , started by  , established numerous tiger reserves. The project was credited with tripling the number of wild Bengal tigers from some 1,200 in 1973 to over 3,500 in the 1990s, but a 2007 census showed that numbers had dropped back to about 1,400 tigers because of poaching.  Following the report, the Indian government pledged $153 million to the initiative, set up measures to combat poaching, promised funds to relocate up to 200,000 villagers in order to reduce human-tiger interactions,  and set up eight new  .  India also reintroduced tigers to the   and by 2009 it was claimed that poaching had been effectively countered at  . 
 In the 1940s, the Siberian tiger was on the brink of extinction with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in Russia. As a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the   and a network of protected zones ( ) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred. Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the   collapsed. The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450 km  needed by a single female and more for a single male).  Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and  's in concert with international organisations, such as the   and the  .  The competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters to tolerate the big cats. Tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers.  In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little  .  However, in a decade later, the Siberian tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals. 
 In China, tigers became the target of large-scale ‘anti-pest’ campaigns in the early 1950s, where suitable habitats were fragmented following deforestation and resettlement of people to rural areas, who hunted tigers and prey species. Though tiger hunting was prohibited in 1977, the population continued to decline and is considered extinct in southern China since 2001.  In  's  , camera-traps recorded a tiger with four cubs for the first time in 2012.  During subsequent surveys, between 27 and 34 tigers were documented along the China–Russia border.  Having earlier rejected the Western-led environmentalist movement, China changed its stance in the 1980s and became a party to the   treaty. By 1993 it had banned the trade in tiger parts, and this diminished the use of tiger bones in  .  The  's trade in tiger skins has also been a threat to tigers. The pelts were used in clothing, tiger-skin   being worn as fashion. In 2006 the   was persuaded to take up the issue. Since then there has been a change of attitude, with some Tibetans publicly burning their chubas. 
 In 1994, the Indonesian Sumatran Tiger Conservation Strategy addressed the potential crisis that tigers faced in Sumatra. The Sumatran Tiger Project (STP) was initiated in June 1995 in and around the   in order to ensure the long-term viability of wild Sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations.  By August 1999, the teams of the STP had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in Lampung Province, of which only 15 these were intact enough to contain tigers.  In the framework of the STP a community-based conservation programme was initiated to document the tiger-human dimension in the park in order to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions. 
 The   and   formed the collaboration  , with field sites including the world's largest tiger reserve, the 21,756 km  (8,400 sq mi)   in Myanmar. Other reserves were in the   in India, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, the Russian Far East covering in total about 260,000 km  (100,000 sq mi). 
 Tigers have been studied in the wild using a variety of techniques. Tiger population have been estimated using plaster casts of their  , although this method was criticized as being inaccurate.  More recent techniques include the use of   and studies of   from tiger scat, while   has been used to track tigers in the wild.  Tiger spray has been found to be just as good, or better, as a source of DNA than scat. 
 The tiger has been one of the   animals of  . Tiger hunting took place on a large scale in the early 19th and 20th centuries, being a recognised and admired sport by the   in   as well as the   and aristocratic class of the erstwhile princely states of pre-independence India. A single maharaja or English hunter could claim to kill over a hundred tigers in their hunting career.  Tiger hunting was done by some hunters on foot; others sat up on   with a goat or buffalo tied out as bait; yet others on elephant-back. 
 Historically, tigers have been hunted at a large scale so their famous striped skins could be collected. The trade in tiger skins peaked in the 1960s, just before international conservation efforts took effect. By 1977, a tiger skin in an   market was considered to be worth US$4,250. 
 Tiger parts are commonly used as   in   and  . In the Philippines, the fossils in Palawan were found besides stone tools. This, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, suggests that early humans had accumulated the bones,  and the condition of the tiger subfossils, dated to approximately 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, differed from other fossils in the assemblage, dated to the  . The tiger subfossils showed longitudinal fracture of the   due to weathering, which suggests that they had   been exposed to light and air. Tiger canines were found in Ambangan sites dating to the   to   centuries in  ,  . 
 Many people in China and other parts of Asia have a belief that various tiger parts have medicinal properties, including as pain killers and  .  There is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs. The use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical drugs in China is already banned, and the government has made some offences in connection with tiger poaching punishable by death.  Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the   and a domestic trade ban has been in place in China since 1993. 
 However, the trading of tiger parts in   has become a major black market industry and governmental and conservation attempts to stop it have been ineffective to date.  Almost all black marketers engaged in the trade are based in   and have either been shipped and sold within in their own country or into  ,   or  .  The Chinese subspecies was almost completely decimated by killing for commerce due to both the parts and skin trades in the 1950s through the 1970s.  Contributing to the illegal trade, there are a number of tiger farms in the country specialising in breeding the cats for profit. It is estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 captive-bred, semi-tame animals live in these farms today.  However, many tigers for traditional medicine black market are wild ones shot or snared by   and may be caught anywhere in the tiger's remaining range (from Siberia to India to the   to  ). In the Asian black market, a tiger penis can be worth the equivalent of around $300  . In the years of 1990 through 1992, 27 million products with tiger derivatives were found.  In July 2014 at an international convention on endangered species in  ,  , a Chinese representative admitted for the first time his government was aware trading in tiger skins was occurring in China. 
 Wild tigers that have had no prior contact with humans actively avoid interactions with humans. However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal.  Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between a mother and her young,  or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle.  Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey.  For example, the  , a tigress found in   and then  , had two broken canines. She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, by the time she was shot in 1907 by  .  According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch.  Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics. 
 Man-eaters have been a particular problem in recent decades in India and Bangladesh, especially in  ,   and the   mangrove swamps of  , where some healthy tigers have hunted humans. Because of rapid habitat loss attributed to  , tiger attacks have increased in the Sundarbans.  The Sundarbans area had 129 human deaths from tigers from 1969 to 1971. In the 10 years prior to that period, about 100 attacks per year in the Sundarbans, with a high of around 430 in some years of the 1960s.  Unusually, in some years in the Sundarbans, more humans are killed by tigers than vice versa.  In 1972, India's production of   and beeswax dropped by 50% when at least 29 people who gathered these materials were devoured.  In 1986 in the Sundarbans, since tigers almost always attack from the rear, masks with human faces were worn on the back of the head, on the theory that tigers usually do not attack if seen by their prey. This decreased the number of attacks only temporarily. All other means to prevent attacks, such as providing more prey or using electrified human dummies, did not work as well. 
 In   times, tigers were kept in   and   to be exhibited, trained and paraded, and were often provoked to fight humans and exotic beasts.  Since the 17th century, tigers, being rare and ferocious, were sought after to keep at European   as symbols of their owners' power.  Tigers became central   and   exhibits in the 18th century: a tiger could cost up to 4,000   in France (for comparison, a professor of the Beaux-Arts at Lyons earned only 3,000 francs a year),  or up to $3,500 in the United States, where a lion cost no more than $1,000. 
 In 2007, over 4,000 captive tigers lived in China, of which 3,000 were held by about 20 larger facilities, with the rest held by some 200 smaller facilities.  In 2011, 468 facilities in the USA kept 2,884 tigers.  Nineteen US states banned private ownership of tigers, fifteen require a license, and sixteen states have no regulation.    of 105 captive tigers from fourteen countries and regions showed that forty-nine animals belonged distinctly to five subspecies; fifty-two animals had mixed subspecies origins.  Many Siberian tigers in zoos today are actually the result of crosses with Bengal tigers." 
 Tigers and their superlative qualities have been a source of fascination for mankind since ancient times, and they are routinely visible as important cultural and media motifs. They are also considered one of the  , and are used as the face of conservation campaigns worldwide. In a 2004 online poll conducted by cable television channel  , involving more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog.

In   and  , the tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirits and a sacred creature that brings good luck – the symbol of courage and absolute power. For the people who live in and around the forests of Korea, the tiger considered the symbol of the Mountain Spirit or King of mountain animals. So, Koreans also called the tigers "San Gun" (산군) means Mountain Lord.

  He was up there somewhere, at the top of the hill, the man Karl Ammann had come to see. It would soon be night. The forest was all shadows and sounds. Ammann had driven across the country to reach this remote river village, and now he was finally here, looking to the top of the hill, ready to confront the person he believed had murdered more tigers than anyone in Laos. In the distance, he could hear them: dozens of tigers roaring.
       300 MILES CHina Myanmar Laos Vientiane Thailand Cambodia Gulf of Thailand Detail 
		For nearly five years, Ammann, 70, a Swiss counter-trafficking conservationist, had tracked the tiger butcher, a man named Nikhom Keovised. He had placed hidden cameras inside what had once been the largest tiger farm in Southeast Asia, an illegal operation where tigers had been raised to one end — slaughter — and where the man doing the slaughtering had been Nikhom. And he had listened to Nikhom describe it all in his own words: “Use the anesthetic,” he had said. “Then just cut the neck.” Then “peel its skin.”
	 
		Now Nikhom had established himself here, in this half-splash of civilization near the Vietnam border, where he’d just opened what his boss — considered one of the nation’s biggest wildlife traffickers — described as a zoo, but what Ammann suspected was a front for selling tigers.
	 
		Ammann knew the risks. He was in the country without permission to investigate its wildlife practices. He was unarmed. Neither Nikhom nor his boss, who didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment, had ever been charged with anything, let alone arrested. If discovered, the equipment Ammann had with him — the drone, the hidden cameras, the satellite images of the country’s tiger farms — would immediately unravel his cover story, that he was a tourist here on a lark.
	 
		But he could already feel the familiar intensity. It had driven him to undertake dozens of risky, self-funded investigations, pushed him to the fringes of the conservation community and caused even friends to describe him as obsessive, if not a little crazy. He couldn’t stop. Those responsible had to be held to account. Species by species, the world is rapidly undergoing an ecological transformation, becoming barely recognizable from the planet it was a few centuries ago. It is a world reckoning with an end of wildness, where humanity and domesticated animals account for almost all mammal biomass, and the tiger, whose captive population now dwarfs its numbers in the wild, is on the verge of becoming a fully industrialized commodity.
	 
		For 10 days late last year, I joined Ammann on an undercover journey to the core of the modern tiger economy to determine whether Laos, a global hub of wildlife trafficking, had fulfilled its promises since 2016 to stamp out the wildlife trade. The trip had been dangerous from the beginning, and then gotten riskier, and now we’d arrived to this hill, where, above, the tigers were becoming louder.
	 
		They were hungry, Ammann announced. It would soon be time to feed them. He slung his camera over his shoulder and started up the hill, in search of tigers and their warden.

		Over the past century or so, the tiger population has plunged in the wild, dropping from an estimated 100,000 to fewer than 4,000, while the number in captivity has exploded to more than 12,500. Nowhere else is the animal’s commodification more complete than in tiger farming, where it is raised, butchered for parts and sold for tens of thousands of dollars. And nowhere else have these farms operated with greater impunity than in Laos, an obscure communist nation whose own wild tigers have nearly all been killed. Ammann was one of the few people who’d seen inside the country’s farms.

		When I’d first spoken to him in June of last year, I’d expected to find someone who was, if not optimistic, then at least hopeful. In a smattering of countries in South Asia, the tiger’s population appeared to be stabilizing, even as it cratered elsewhere. And since 2016, international authorities and some conservationists had applauded Laos, home to some of Asia’s biggest wildlife traffickers, as it announced overhauls to finally clean up the trade. Shops trading in bones and wildlife merchandise were to cease. All three of the country’s illegal tiger farms, which stored 700 tigers, were ordered to stop farming and convert into zoos and conservation centers. No new facilities breeding endangered wildlife for commercial purposes would open. From the outside, things seemed to be getting a bit better. Even Britain’s Prince William had reportedly taken up the cause.
	 
		But Ammann was neither optimistic nor hopeful, and, if anything, seemed offended by the suggestion. In our first substantive phone conversation, he immediately plunged into the arcana of tiger farming in Laos, citing operational tiger farms and going on and on about “lip service” and how we were being taken for “bloody fools.” While Ammann vented, I searched for images of him. He looked the same in every one: mustachioed and grimacing, an expression of the frustration and futility in his voice.

		“They all want hope and happy endings,” he said of producers and audiences who ignored his documentaries, despite their findings. “And I don’t see any happy endings. I can’t create fiction from what I see as fact.”
	 
		We ended the phone call, with him promising to send me some photographs and documents from a trip he’d just taken to Laos to work on a   about tiger trafficking. I felt dazed. Who was that guy? And if he didn’t feel there was any hope, why did he assume so much risk going into some of the world’s most remote forests, without institutional support or funding, to document the destruction?
	 
		From then on, in interviews with conservationists about tiger trafficking, I saved a few questions for the end: Just what do you think of Ammann? Almost everyone I asked immediately knew who Ammann was and said his findings were sound. He could be trusted — but.
	 
		But what?
	 
		“He takes a lot of risks,” Steve Galster, a counter-trafficking expert in Bangkok, said after a long pause.
	 
		“A difficult character,” said Crawford Allan, a senior director at World Wildlife Fund, an international conservation organization with an office in Washington. Ammann had been kicked out of an international conservation meeting for aggressively confronting officials and was known to send environmentalists notes denigrating their work after they’d just trumpeted it in press releases.
	 
		“A bit of a kook who gets results,” a law enforcement consultant in Laos, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, called him.
	 
		Ammann had sent me some of those results. I pulled up the documents and photographs on my computer, and immediately recoiled.
	 
		The first one was of a diseased tiger in a claustrophobic cage — mangy, eyes desperate, death coming.

		Two more were from high above, where Ammann had flown a drone to capture images of two massive tiger farms, showing the animals in cage after cage. He included a 3,700-word missive he’d dispatched to the U.N. commission charged with regulating the wildlife trade, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), accusing the organization of being “a big part of the problem.” He’d sent the same letter to a European Parliament official, attaching this comment: “So you cannot say you did not know. My motto for doing this.”
	 
		I called Ammann, who was home in his estate at the base of Mount Kenya, where he keeps as “dependents” two orphaned chimpanzees. I asked whether he was planning on going to Laos again. He said he was — and it would be before year’s end. In the coming weeks, in fact, he’d have the itinerary all planned out. This time, he hoped to take his investigation even further, stepping out from behind the hidden cameras to personally meet those who’d profited from the death of the tiger.
	 
		“Why don’t you come,” he asked, “and see for yourself?”
	 
		After a 24-hour flight, I arrived at my hotel in northern Thailand past midnight. There was a note waiting for me from Ammann. We’d planned to meet the next morning at 8, given my late arrival, but now the note said that wasn’t early enough. We had to meet at 7. A long day was ahead, and there was no time to waste.
	 
		After a fast handshake and a few quick words in the morning, we were inside a van, bumping toward the Laos border. My editors and I had decided that I would enter the country without identifying myself as a journalist, an exception to The Washington Post’s usual practice. I would travel with Ammann and planned to accompany him everywhere, taking notes and quietly snapping photos. If someone asked about my profession or my employer, I knew I’d have to answer truthfully. But no one did.
	 
		Ammann wanted to cross into the country by nightfall, where he said the real journey would begin. Landlocked and mountainous, Laos has nearly 1,600 miles of borders with Vietnam and China, whose appetite for illicit wildlife products had both decimated numerous species and transformed Laos into a global epicenter of wildlife trade. Last October, the U.S. State Department again listed Laos as one of three countries whose government “actively engaged in or knowingly profited” from trafficking endangered species. CITES in a 2017 report was even blunter: “Everyone can buy everything and cross the border.”
	 Traveling across central Laos. 
		Over the next 10 days, Ammann planned to traverse much of the country, beginning in a northern region called the Golden Triangle to visit a casino town notorious for wildlife trafficking and investigate rumors of a never-before-identified tiger enclosure. And then he’d head south, stopping to buy tiger products from merchants in the country’s biggest cities, fly drones over tiger farms and search for clues involving the mysterious disappearance of 300 tigers from one of them. Lastly, he’d venture to a new resort and “zoo” named Say Namthurn, where Ammann hoped to finally meet Nikhom, the tiger butcher, along with his boss, Sakhone Keosouvanh, who helped bring tiger farming to Laos.
	 
		Inside the van now, along with Ammann, were his cameraman, Phil Hattingh, a towering South African; and a young Chinese woman named Grace Chan. Ammann had met Chan, who’s from Hong Kong, in autumn 2017, after she’d contacted him to discuss elephant trafficking. She’d told him she wanted to save animals, so he had introduced her to what he believed was the best way of doing that — his way.
	 
		“They’ll think you’re a customer,” Ammann said to Chan, explaining his plan for her on this trip. “I have the perfect cover story for you.” She was to visit shops all over Laos while wearing a hidden camera to buy tiger products, masquerading as a young assistant to a Hong Kong businessman who wanted tiger parts to impress his friends. To bolster her expertise on the tiger economy, Ammann would soon pull out a tattered book and hand it to her.
	 
		It was a taxonomy of tiger bones, showing pictures of the skull, femur, tibia, hip. The book described the bones as a “precious crude medicine,” whose medicinal use in China traced back more than 1,400 years. But as China’s economy grew, the animal’s mythical qualities — none of which are substantiated by modern medicine — ignited a market for tiger products that, the book said, “sold well domestically and abroad.”
	 
		So well, in fact, that within years of the book’s 1979 publication, a country as vast as China estimated it had only a few dozen tigers left, and something needed to be done. The Chinese government passed a law that banned killing endangered species in the wild while encouraging their “domestication” and breeding. The idea was that the farms would expand the tiger population, sating demand for tiger products while protecting those in the wild. But that wasn’t what happened. Instead, demand exploded further, said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who’s studied the industry, inciting rampant poaching of wild tigers all over Asia and ushering in an era of “catastrophic consumption.”
	 Captive tigers soon outnumbered those in the wild, as habitat loss accelerated and a supply chain of poaching and farming spread across the continent. Using nearly every part of the tiger, a growing collection of “medicines” and improbable luxury products followed. 
		There were efforts to get things under control. Chinese officials in 1993 prohibited domestic trade in tiger bone but didn’t close the country’s many farms, which by 2007 warehoused more than 5,000 tigers. That year, CITES, an international authority with few enforcement tools, banned tiger farming for commercial purposes. China chafed against the restrictions then, and now. Last autumn, it legalized trade in tiger parts for medicinal purposes but, under international pressure, quickly reinstated its ban.
	 
		To bypass it, some Chinese customers flock to border towns sprinkled throughout the Golden Triangle area, where the countries of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand converge, and where weaker rule of law and government corruption abet black market wildlife trade. That was exactly what Ammann wanted to investigate first.
	 
		We drove into the night, passing miles of undeveloped countryside, until a city sprang out of the blackness like a vision. Lexuses and Mercedes wheeled down its streets with license plates from all over China. Big hotels blinked with green and red lights. People swarmed around a large casino with a crown of gold at the town’s center.

		Known as the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone, this sliver of Bokeo Province is controlled by a transnational criminal operation that “engages in an array of horrendous illicit activities,” including child prostitution and human, drug and wildlife trafficking, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, which last year imposed sanctions on the network. “Sin city,”  the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency, a non-governmental organization, called the zone in a 2015 report — a “lawless playground” where an exclusive clientele of Chinese tourists could buy tiger parts in shops and eat tiger meat at restaurants. Just about the only Lao element of the town was geography. Clocks here were set to Beijing time, business was done in renminbi, and the dominant language was Mandarin.

		On our first morning here, I could tell Ammann was already exasperated. His driver was not going fast enough, no matter how many times Ammann told him to pick it up. His computer had stopped working. The hotel where we’d spent the night before — the only one that still took Western guests following the U.S. sanctions — had just told us to clear out. And now Chan was running late.
	 
		“Come on, Grace,” he said, waiting outside the hotel for her.
	 
		“Come on, Grace,” he said, less than a minute later.
	 
		“We’ve got to go,” he said again.
	 
		“Tell her to come,” he finally snapped, directing his Lao guide to go get her.
	 
		Chan finally got into the van, and Ammann told the driver to get moving.
	 
		He knew how he sometimes sounded, but there was no time for niceties, not while the world was committing suicide. In conversations, he frequently brought up environmental studies he’d just read, all of them apparently grim. Between 1970 and 2014, vertebrate populations dropped in size an average of 60 percent. One million plant and animal species now face extinction. The planet could soon lose 60 percent of primate species, according to a study in the peer-reviewed journal, Science Advances, noting how bush-meat hunting had sped their demise — a revelation that, to Ammann, wasn’t a revelation at all. It was his origin story.
	 Karl Ammann, far left, and his cameraman, Phil Hattingh, in eastern Laos. 
		In 1988, Ammann was in a long boat chugging up the Congo River in what was then Zaire. By then, he’d already spent two decades in Africa, where he had worked as a hotelier and photographer, eventually becoming wealthy opening and selling an eco-tourism camp in Kenya’s Maasai Mara National Reserve. But along the river’s banks, he saw an Africa he didn’t know. Hundreds of slaughtered primates were strewn near the water’s edge, awaiting transport to nearby markets to be sold as bush meat. Deforestation had provided hunters with access to animals previously protected by dense jungle, giving rise to an underground economy.
	 
		The bush-meat hunts, the markets, the outrage he’d felt at their discovery: It soon consumed him. In the early 1990s, at a time when little was known about the bush-meat trade, he went to remote merchants and logging encampments, looking for apes orphaned by bush-meat hunters, and returned with gruesome images that few could stomach. Decapitated gorillas. Charbroiled monkeys. Butchered chimpanzees. His photography blurred into activism. He published books, lobbied governments, led international petitions against wildlife slaughter and took nearly every media opportunity that came his way. He described it all as graphically as he could, hoping to shock people into action. “Up to their elbows in blood,” he said of bush-meat hunters in one 1995 newspaper interview. It was “98.5 cannibalism” to eat chimps, he said in another. “Maybe I’ve become too extreme,” he confessed in one more, and many conservationists then agreed.
	 
		Jane Goodall, the renowned chimpanzee conservationist, said he was too aggressive, and he said she wasn’t aggressive enough. Other conservationists accused him of “cultural imperialism,” and he countered that they worried more about fundraising than truth.
	 
		“He won’t stop,” says his wife, Kathy, even after his findings were substantiated, and he was named a Time magazine Hero of the Environment in 2007 for “almost single-handedly raising awareness of the issue of bush meat,” and was told again and again to slow down. His marriage was suffering. Commitment had collided with obsession. “Just part of the furniture” was how Kathy said she’d come to feel, seeing him at the computer, emailing and researching all day. Two personalities jostle inside him, said Dale Peterson, a former collaborator. He was one person around people — combative, cynical, “miserable,” as Peterson put it — and another around animals. That was the Ammann who’d for decades cared for a chimpanzee he’d saved from hunters, or who would stop and discuss even a small bird, he said, “in the most affectionate way.” He was “driven by something larger.”
	 
		That intensity building within, he pulled up to the market along the Mekong River, straddling the Lao-Thai border. The door opened, out Chan went, and from the market entrance, Ammann watched her disappear into the stalls.
	 
		She was dressed in black. Black hat. Black sunglasses. Black blouse, the top button of which concealed the camera. Ammann wanted us to keep our distance from her at first, knowing the illegal wildlife trade had increasingly receded from public view, just as it once had with bush meat. Sellers these days store their jewelry and medicine in backrooms and hidden drawers that open only for wealthy Chinese customers — which was how Ammann hoped Chan would appear. He followed her into the market.
	 We met her near the back, at the counter of an open-air store named Exotic Family. There, a thin Chinese salesman was drinking tea, wearing rings on both hands, saying, yes, he had tiger parts to sell. We watched him light a cigarette, and out came a small, hollowed tiger bone with intricate carvings: $223. Also a tiger claw: $223. And two tiger fangs: $1,340. 
		Ammann asked to see more. The man pulled out his phone and sent a contact request on the messaging app WeChat to Chan, who held up the screen for Ammann and myself to see.
	 
		She already knew the digital netherworld of wildlife trading, where all she needed to do was enter a few keywords — “jelly” for ivory, “king” for tiger products — to thwart a blanket prohibition on the trade on China’s leading commerce sites. The ban, instituted in 2012, had gotten rid of a lot of the listings, but it hadn’t gotten rid of them all, not with an evolving lexicon of code words and not with social media, where much of the trade has migrated and is more difficult to detect. Elephant-skin powder pills, black-bear gallbladder bile and tiger-bone jewelry: Chan had seen it all. But one rare product didn’t appear on the seller’s WeChat profile. Did he have any tiger skin for sale?
	 
		“No tiger skins anymore. You can find them in Vietnam,” he said in Chinese. “In Vietnam, there are more tiger farms.”
	 
		“But Laos has a lot of tiger farms, too,” Ammann said.
	 
		“Tigers in Laos are now protected,” the merchant said.
	 
		Ammann looked at him strangely. He knew Laos had vowed to close its tiger farms and stop the trade in wildlife products, but yet here this merchant was, doing just that. So how likely was it that much had changed? The government, after all, had more than two years ago promised a “full audit,” funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to determine the number and origin of the country’s captive tigers. But it had faced numerous delays. And the same tiger breeders the government had previously accused of breaking the law were still involved in the operations, where the tiger population has been fluctuating dramatically, indicating possible trade.
	 Post Reports | Podcast Terrence McCoy on Karl Ammann’s fight to save the world’s tigers. 
		The number of tigers on one farm named Vannaseng surged from 102 to 235, then fell to 111, according to public records and Lao government documents that I reviewed. Another one called Vinasakhone — where Nikhom had worked — reported a sudden loss of 300 tigers in 2017, shedding three-fourths of its population, without ever explaining how that happened. Then a new and massive farm was disclosed by a Vietnamese news outlet in April 2017 in the central Laos town of Lak Sao and as of last year housed 106 tigers. Lao government officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment to discuss these issues.
	 
		Ammann, walking away from the stall and the market, believed there were even more tiger enclosures now in Laos, which hadn’t yet been identified. One was rumored to be right here in the Golden Triangle: He had to find out whether it was true.
	 
		We drove several miles, coming to a stop on a desolate dirt road wedged between thatched-roof huts and jungle. Ammann got out of the car. This was where an informant had told him to look. Up ahead, he saw a complex of structures behind a tall wall. “Turn the car around,” Ammann said curtly to the driver. “And turn the engine off.” He reached for his camera and approached the walls, from which hung several signs, praising the facility’s supposed role in conservation.
	 
		“Caring rare animals, protect the blue planet,” said one in English.
	 
		“Growing with animals and die without them,” said another, also in English.
	 
		Ammann turned on his camera and held it at his hip.
	 “This must be it,” he said, walking up to the metal gates of a compound said to be controlled by the local criminal syndicate. He started banging. No answer. He banged again, then stuck his camera between a crack in the gates. A young shirtless man came to see what was going on. Ammann decided to bluff his way in. “Tell him Mr. He sent us here,” Ammann directed Chan, who had no idea what he was talking about, but decided to do it anyway. I stood a few feet behind Ammann, waiting for the worker to puncture the cover story and turn us away, but Ammann kept staring at the gate, which was slightly ajar. Ammann vanished beyond the wall. Chan and I looked at each other briefly, unsure, then followed. A sound that I’d never heard before then came into Ammann’s voice, one of joy and wonder. Around the corner, back in the darkness of one of the structures, stripes were moving. Even after all this time, seeing tigers up close like this stunned him. They were so big, moving with the latent energy of coiled springs. I ran to another enclosure to photograph whatever was there. Then a tiger paw streaked out through the bars, and I was yelling, jerking my arm away. The worker wanted us out. He was staring at Ammann, who continued to film. Then I was telling Ammann that we had to leave. The worker was calling his boss again. I didn’t want to be here when he showed up. 
		One more look, and then his camera was down, and he was in the car, and it was pulling away, and he couldn’t help but shake his head.
	 
		“Yeah, but Laos is closing down the tiger farms, isn’t it?” he said.
	 
		Days later, after Chan had bought and filmed tiger parts being sold in shops all over Laos, and after we’d left her in the capital of Vientiane with her job complete, Ammann looked out the van’s window, as the city receded into exurbs. We were heading across the country to the Vietnam border in search of Nikhom at the new resort of Say Namthurn, and he was in a darker mood than usual. “We’re just the biggest parasite this world has ever known,” he said, seeing trash and cars and humanity pressing in from every direction.
	 
		In times like this, he often looked at his life’s work, at all of the risks taken, all the rules broken, all the hours and money and emotion consumed in his investigations, and saw only failure. Endangered animals were still getting killed. The tiger’s range had shrunk to about 7 percent of its historic sweep. And mainstream conservationists: They’d done what? Their attempts to stop poaching, their reintroduction of captive-born predators into the wild, their law enforcement crackdowns — all failures. To Ammann, conservation efforts were almost always doomed, and anyone who said otherwise was either fundraising or a “naive, gullible a—hole with nothing better to do.”
	 
		“It’s frustrating to care about something this much,” Ammann went on. “Am I wasting my time? And if I can’t get people to watch and to care, then I should just shoot myself.”
	 
		Several times during the trip, I’d asked him if he should take it easier. Enjoy his money. Spend more time at home with his wife. Why continue if this made him unhappy, if he thought the work was futile?
	 
		“The real challenge starts when you know, ‘I’m never going to win,’ but you keep going,” he answered once. “It doesn’t make you stupid, or heroic, but something in between. If I’ve had a few bad nights’ sleep over what I’ve seen, well, let me give a few others a bad night’s of sleep. . . . It’s easy to sell hope. But hope without action is an excuse.”

		The van now crossed a muddy river, continuing along Route 8, which streaked into mountains rising sheer against the horizon. The town of Lak Sao soon came into view, and Ammann, seeing an upcoming intersection, said we had to stop, suddenly sounding energized. There was a tiger farm nearby.
	 
		We bounced off the main highway, forked into a quiet village and rolled onto an unmarked dirt path. “This is it,” Ammann said. Just down this road was the Lak Sao tiger farm, with around 100 tigers inside, if not more. Outside the van’s tinted windows, people were resting underneath thatched roofs and stilted homes, and inside, Hattingh, the cameraman, was reaching into his bag. Out came the drone. They had five minutes — 10 tops — to get what they needed and get out.
	 
		“If you see people running, bring it home and get out of there,” Ammann said. “This is one of those things where if you get caught, if they catch you with a drone and no license, they can throw the book at you.”
	 
		Ammann told the driver to turn the van around to allow a fast escape, and Hattingh climbed out, saying, “I’m going to disappear.” He stepped into the bush behind the back of the compound, hidden behind tall concrete walls. The drone, the size of a hawk and buzzing like the world’s loudest cicada, levitated into the air.
	 
		The video beamed back into a handheld screen, showing tigers pacing in their cages, appearing as small as insects. Meanwhile, villagers told Ammann and me about life next to a tiger farm.
	 
		This operation wasn’t like the last one, not another small tiger enclosure hidden away in the hills. This was industrial.
	 
		The drone came down. Hattingh hurried back. I asked the woman her name. She glanced down the road at the farm, then back at me, looking concerned. “Lek,” she offered, and nothing more. She drew a finger across the length of her neck to indicate her fear.
	 
		We got in the van, and Ammann told the driver to hit it.
	 
		Deeper into the countryside we went, mile after mile, land rising into mountains then plunging into ravines, greens and browns washing by, until there came the river village of Tha Bak. On one side of the road, there was a line of small, cavernous houses. On the other side, a sign announced the resort of Say Namthurn, listing its offerings: golf course, drinking water, zoo.
	 
		Ammann got out of the car. He could hear tigers roaring. The sounds were coming from up there, atop a hill shrouded by forest. He reached for his camera.
	 300 MILES CHina Myanmar Laos Vientiane Tha Bak Thailand Cambodia Gulf of Thailand Detail 
		That is where he hoped to find Nikhom.
	 
		Ammann first heard that name in early 2014. He’d been tracking two tiger cubs that had disappeared before he could buy them from a Lao poacher. His investigation had brought him to central Laos, where Vinasakhone, the country’s biggest farm, stored hundreds of tigers behind concrete walls near the Mekong River.
	 
		Its co-owner at the time was a short man named Sakhone Keosouvanh, who hasn’t responded to repeated requests for comment, delivered throughout April by email, messaging services, telephone and certified mail. Unremarkable in appearance but equipped with established government connections, he helped craft Laos’s failed plan to save the country’s last tigers and represented tiger farmers at an international tiger preservation meeting. His farm promoted itself as helping to preserve the tiger population.
	 Sakhone Keosouvanh. 
		Meanwhile, tiger breeding, killing and selling was going on inside those walls, according to Laos government reports I’ve reviewed, and the man who oversaw much of it was Nikhom, who also hasn’t responded to numerous requests for comment.
	 
		Nikhom was the one who met with an investigator Ammann had sent into the farm equipped with a hidden camera and the cover story that he was there to inquire about four tigers — three females and one male — for a farm that his “millionaire” Chinese boss wanted to build.
	 
		“We are happy to sell some for you,” Nikhom had said, according to a transcription of the recording translated into English. The farm, he explained, could transport them to the Chinese border by two means. One was by helicopter — “We use the army helicopter,” he said. “Or we can sell them in pieces.”
	 
		“What do you mean ‘pieces’?” the investigator asked, taken aback. “Then the tigers would be dead.”
	 
		“That’s what we normally do,” Nikhom responded, before backtracking, seemingly worried about divulging too much. “I think we need to agree to the price first before we talk about other things.”
	 
		Over the coming months, the investigator, who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety, would often call Nikhom at Ammann’s prompting. The two men soon developed a friendship. The investigator would take Nikhom out for drinks, then secretly record their conversations about women, beer and tigers. “It always cost me,” Ammann later groused. “A lot of alcohol and meals on my invoice.” Soon the investigator was loaning Nikhom money, they were calling each other “brother,” and Nikhom was delving into how tigers were illegally bred, killed and harvested for parts at a level that staggered Ammann.
	 
		During the first 10 months of 2014 alone, the farm known as Vinasakhone traded an extraordinary amount — nearly 11 tons — of lion and tiger bone, the former of which is sometimes passed off as tiger bone, according to one government document by the Lao Division of Forest Inspection that I obtained. The report, first reported by the Guardian, accused the farm of breaking international and local law. But no action could be taken against it. The farm had “approval from government,” which imposed an extra tax of 2 percent on all wildlife exports, according to a 2003 Laos customs document that I received from an investigator connected to Thai intelligence. A 2016 confidential survey of the country’s wildlife farms by the Lao Department of Forest Resource Management, which I also reviewed, said the farm wasn’t breeding tigers for “scientific research” — as its permit stated — but for slaughter. “The animal is killed at the farm by knockdown injection, removing all intestines so they keep only the body with skin, bones and meat, covered with plastic sheet for shipment,” the survey said, noting one corpse was believed to go for $30,000.
	 
		“We use this anesthetic” was how Nikhom described the process in a conversation with Ammann’s investigator, which The Post had translated. “They start to walk unstably to the left and right and then fall down.”
	 
		“How do you kill it?” the investigator asked.
	 
		Some have their throats cut. But many clients refuse to buy pierced skin, so “we use the elastic string to tighten its neck . . . until it died.”
	 
		Afterward, some buyers want the meat:
	 “Not like cutting the skin of a cow or buffalo, we need to make it an excellent cut, and when we peel the skin, we must be careful not to pierce it.” ບໍ່ຄືໜັງງົວໜັງຄວາຍ ບໍ່ໃຫ້ເຈີດພຸ້ນເຈິດພີ້ ແລ້ວເວລາເຮົາປາດ ບໍ່ໃຫ້ມັນຊອດ 
		“We have to take out all of its meat,” Nikhom said. “When we eat it, it’s just normal to grill or burn it. Its flesh is normal.”
	 
		Others want the bones: “They want the one with more bones. Some people, when they see the fat one and choose it, they only get the weight. For someone who knows . . . they will select the thin one. They will consider the bone.”
	 
		And others only want a dense block of hardened resin known as tiger glue:
	 
		“We cut the bone again and break the bone into small pieces, and then we boil again,” Nikhom said. “It will take two to three days to boil it. Then we take out the water and refill water many times, and make it really boil. Then we separate the soup. We take out the boiling water and refill, until the bone is soft and easy to break. Then it means it finishes.”
	 
		Boiled or frozen, Ammann realized, dead or alive — tigers had been sold. The operation expanded until 2016, when a new Lao administration came to power and, yielding to international demands, announced in a statement that the farms would close, accusing them of illegally “trading tiger products to international buyers.” Soon after, 300 of Vinasakhone’s 400 tigers vanished. Then Sakhone, the co-owner, abandoned the farm, beginning a new tiger operation out here, near a border checkpoint notorious for wildlife trafficking. And with him, Ammann heard from his investigator, he had brought along his longtime farm manager, Nikhom.
	 
		“If Sakhone is here, we have to be careful,” Ammann said. The tiger farmer had connections up and down the border, Ammann believed, and had been so well protected that he’d never faced charges or consequences despite the government allegations against   of his previous operation. Ammann worried about that power. Our intentions for being there couldn’t be discovered.
	 
		Thinking it would come off as suspicious to charge up the hill to see the tigers, we walked through a tourist attraction bereft of tourists to the restaurant patio along the river. “There he is,” Ammann said softly, seeing him across the patio. Sakhone was turning to face us, then coming our way, wearing a blue button-down, gold ring and watch, with a Toyota Hilux key dangling from his belt loop. For so long, Ammann had known Sakhone only as a name on investigative reports and translated transcripts. But now he was gripping Ammann’s hand and smiling broadly. Sakhone took a seat at our table and looked us over. Beers arrived.
	 
		Ammann, playing the role of tourist, did the talking. Through an interpreter, he asked Sakhone how he’d made his money.
	 
		“An import-export company,” Sakhone said.
	 
		Ammann asked what he exported.
	 
		“Mainly coal,” Sakhone said.
	 
		Ammann later told me he’d had the urge to turn on his camera and confront him, just like he had confronted so many others. He wanted to tell him that he’d actually exported tigers — and accuse him of still doing it. “We breed them to get their babies” to sell, Nikhom had recently told Ammann’s investigator, illegal trade an investigative Vietnamese agency has discovered as well. “The Laotian government is ignoring major trafficking across the border,” an agency official said on the condition of anonymity. Then there was something else: Ammann had learned what he believed was the truth of the missing 300 tigers from Sakhone’s farm. Many had been killed, frozen and trafficked, according to Nikhom and interviews I’ve had with two other people with knowledge of the missing tigers. But Ammann could say none of this, not here, not like this.
	 
		Instead, Ammann glanced out into the forests on the other side of the river. They looked so dense. So dark. Surely anything could be out there, even still.
	 
		“What animals are left in this forest?” he asked, waving a hand toward the trees. “Are there any tigers left?”
	 
		Sakhone looked at him for a moment, his face blank.
	 
		“No,” he finally said. “None of those.”
	 
		The tigers weren’t in the forest, but up the hill, on the other side of the resort, moaning all night, a sound that grew louder the next day, as morning gave way to afternoon. Ammann walked along the river and checked his watch: 4 p.m. It would soon be time to feed the tigers. He settled his camera over his shoulder and started up the hill.
	 Ammann went past the gates, the view of the river far below him. He kept his gaze fixed on the ramshackle structure on a bed of gravel — chain-link fencing, anchored by poles and patched with blue tarp. The sound of groaning tigers was all around.
             
 He went inside. Behind two lines of fencing, on either side of the narrow hallway, were flashes of teeth and slate green eyes. Thirty-five tigers, some weighing over 400 pounds, stalked back and forth, back and forth, housed separately in 9-by-12 cages. 
		Every now and then, a worker would pull open a side door connecting the cages, and in would come another tiger. The two would mate then separate, an act that Ammann and I witnessed three times in less than an hour. Standing here, I realized, the existence of the tiger had been reduced to this: endless pacing, speed breeding and an afternoon meal of raw chicken hurled into its cage at 5 p.m.
	 
		“You couldn’t license a zoo like this anywhere in the world,” Ammann said. After spending hours here — during which we saw only one group of local tourists pay the admission fee of $2 — he turned to leave. Then, just outside the front entrance, on the gravel, he saw him.
	 
		Nikhom.
	 Nikhom Keovised. 
		He was sitting at a table strewn with beer bottles — a short man with yellowing teeth, wearing dusty black pants and flip-flops.
	 
		From the front of the enclosure, I watched as Ammann walked over to him.
	 
		How many hours had he listened to the farm manager in the recordings? How many times had he heard him describe the most macabre of details in the most perfunctory of ways? And now here Nikhom was, sitting outside a small concrete house, doing nothing more than drinking and smoking after a day of work.
	 
		Ammann and I took seats at his table. Nikhom smiled at the unexpected guests, pouring us beers. This time, however, Ammann did flip on his camera. Then, as his Lao guide interpreted, and I sat watching, he started in with it:
	 
		“We saw three tiger pairs mating, so in three and a half months, how many babies?”
	 
		“So how often do they get tourists?”
	 
		“What is going to happen to these tigers?”
	 
		Nikhom laughed at the questions, not answering or showing any apparent concern. He offered Ammann more beer. He said he’d worked with tigers since 2007, and this enclosure, which he’d taken over seven months before, was just getting started. These tigers would never leave. Few tourists came, but soon there would be more cages filled with tiger cubs. What he didn’t tell Ammann now, but what he’d told Ammann’s informant: The tigers were profoundly inbred, and few cubs were surviving, only 18 so far.
	 
		“So much work needs to be done?” Ammann said, motioning toward the construction, where more cages were being built. Nikhom only laughed again.
	 
		Ammann took one last look at him. Then he finished his drink, turned off his camera and got up from the table. He’d had enough. He left Nikhom to his beer and his tigers and descended the hill, as the day’s last light bloomed orange and red above the mountains.
	 The sun sets over the tiger “zoo” in Tha Bak. 
		Then it was morning. Ammann directed his driver to take him to the capital to present his findings to the local office of CITES, the regulatory authority of international wildlife trade. He stared out the window, as a landscape of jagged mountains dissolved into an endless expanse of arid plains, and thought of Nikhom. He’d always pictured him as a gangster, powerful and menacing, but he hadn’t been that at all. He’d seemed impoverished, in fact, doing what he had to do to survive, just another bit player in a world unable to save itself.
	 
		“I feel less strongly about him being a miserable human being than some of the conservationists,” he said. At least Nikhom was who he presented himself to be, Ammann realized, and the self-congratulatory networkers at the wildlife conferences — “backslapping orgies,” he liked to call them — were not.
	 
		We stopped at another tiger farm so Ammann could fly the drone over it, and then the city was swelling all around. Soon he was walking inside an expansive building behind thick-trunked trees, carrying a briefcase where he’d stored evidence of his findings. Two new tiger enclosures that didn’t look to him like conservation parks or zoos. Ongoing illegal trade in tiger parts. Signs of expansion at several farms. Allegations that many of the missing 300 tigers had been killed. And proof that the same people who had illegally butchered and sold tigers were still acting as keepers of the animals.
	 Ammann walks in to present his findings. 
		Then he was in a barren conference room, facing a CITES bureaucrat. I sat at the end of the table, watching as the anger Ammann had tried to repress at the resort began to build.
	 
		“We know there are two more tiger farms,” Ammann said. “Two   tiger farms! You said you’re closing them down?” On and on he went — “How can your minister say you’re going to close, if now new ones open up?”— but it was no use.
	 
		Take it up with the bosses in Geneva, he was told. There wasn’t anything the office could do with information brought in like this.
	 
		“This is our system,” the official said.
	 
		Several weeks later, on Jan. 7, Ammann would again write to every major official. He would tell them of the “active speed breeding” in Laos, the “noncompliance” to its own reforms and that, despite the country’s stated intent to save the tiger, “nothing has really changed or is changing.” He would wait for a response that would never come, then quickly move on to planning the next trip, this one to Kunming, China, to investigate elephant trafficking. Meanwhile, he would send me frequent emails, recommend follow-up pieces, plot ways to obtain video of tiger cubs being born at Sakhone’s resort — maybe this would be the final piece of evidence that got people to listen — and gripe about the response CITES sent me concerning wildlife trade in Laos.
	 
		“As with any major change in public policy, it will take time to fully implement and enforce,” the statement said. “While the policy of the Lao government is relatively clear, it is not clear how it is being implemented or enforced.”
	 
		But at this moment, inside a spare conference room, there was only a Laos official telling him, “I cannot respond.” And what was there to say to that? So Ammann took down his email address. He thanked him for his time. He picked up his briefcase with the proof he’d never been asked to show and walked out.
	 
		At the entrance of the building, he stopped for a moment, a strange look on his face. On either side of the doorway was a statue of a tiger. Stripes had been etched into their wooden bodies. Each wore a necklace of fake yellow flowers. Their expressions were frozen in garish snarls. Ammann reached down to touch the head of one of the tigers — an animal once defined by ferocity, now an ornament, lifeless and commodified.

 Tigers are the only big cats to have stripes and individuals can be identified by their pattern.But when it comes to predatory adaptations, you wouldn’t expect a coloration of bright orange with black stripes to be top of the list – in fact it might not be on the list at all. However, while we typically see tigers in zoos, conspicuous against the green vegetation in their enclosures, their main prey is ungulates, which cannot detect the range of colours that we primates can. To an animal with comparatively poor vision, the cat’s bold, contrasting colours are much harder to pick out in the long grass. This method of camouflage is an important predatory adaptation. Whereas some large felines rely on co-operative hunting (such as lions) or bursts of intense speed (such as cheetahs), tigers are semi-solitary and depend on their cryptic appearance to ambush prey.

 Tigers are carnivorous mammals, and they mostly eat large prey like deer, wild boar and even elephant calves. And yes, they have occasionally been known to kill and eat people, too. This usually only happens when a tiger is old, ill or injured, and therefore unable to catch their normal prey. But once a tiger has a taste for human meat, they often have to be killed to protect the local people. A tiger’s favourite way of taking down its prey is to lunge at the animal’s neck and hold on tight with its powerful jaws. The prey will normally die from suffocation, but some might bleed out first if the tiger’s canines sever an artery. Tigers are the biggest cat in the wild, yes. Male tigers can grow to be over 3m long and weigh up to 300kg, while female tigers tend to be a bit smaller. However, another big cat has been bred in captivity that’s even larger. If you breed a male lion with a female tiger, you get a liger. These truly enormous cats have no equal in the modern world, growing up to 3.6m long and being considerably heavier than even the biggest tigers – the largest living cat, Hercules the liger, weighs close to 420kg, and the record is a staggering 550kg. Tigers are relatively adaptable and historically lived across huge swathes of Asia. There are now very few left in South-East Asia, but they’re doing relatively well in India, Nepal, Russia and Bhutan. Tiger habitats vary by region, with the larger tigers of colder northern regions (like the Siberian tiger) living in the brutal taiga, while smaller tigers from warmer regions can happily live in arid forests, tropical rainforests and flooded swamplands and mangroves. Researchers think that India holds around half of the world’s remaining wild tigers. There are several Indian national parks that are renowned for their frequent tiger sightings, including Bandhavgarh, Ranthambore and Kanha national parks. Tigers have white spots surrounded by black fur on the back of their ears. It has been suggested that they act as false eyes to warn of their presence or discourage other species from attacking them from behind. Other theories suggest that it helps tiger cubs follow their mother through tall grass. Being an apex predator is tough and, for many species, most pursuits end in failure, while smaller hunters risk losing their hard-won meals to bigger beasts. But which is the deadliest animal and which predator has to work hardest to get a meal? Learn about apex predators and which are the most dangerous? 
 Tigers do not shy away from water and enjoy bathing in streams and lakes to escape the heat in hot climates. In tall grass, rock crevices or caves, tiger cubs are born blind and depend on their mother for protection. Females usually give birth to two to three cubs but can have as many as six. Each litter has a dominant cub who is more active than their siblings and takes the lead in their play. This sibling is usually the first to leave its mother. After 15 months the matured cubs will disperse and find their own territories. In the wild, tigers have a 14 year life span. Once mature, they will spend most of their time living and hunting alone, with the exception of females when they are raising their young. The range of these big cats can be between 20km to 400km. Tigers in cold northern regions tend to have the largest territories. Scent marking allows tigers to communicate with other tigers in their range, and scratching posts are also useful communication tools, as well as helping to keep their claws sharp. Tigers have night vision that is six times better than that of humans, which helps them hunt successfully in the dark. A tiger will mainly hunt pigs and deer but is capable of taking prey larger than itself. The surviving tiger subspecies are the Siberian tiger, South China tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger, Malayan tiger and Bengal tiger. It is believed that between all of those subspecies, there are only 3,000 to 4,500 individuals left in the wild. The Javan tiger and Bali tiger are sadly both thought to have been hunted to extinction. They were most closely related to the Sumatran tiger (and may have even been the same subspecies), which is still clinging on in Indonesia. One of the saddest facts about tigers is that land development has led to around 96 per cent of the tiger’s natural range being lost in the past 100 years. Tigers are also being illegally hunted for their body parts such as bones, skin and teeth to fuel the growing demand for remedies made from tiger parts in Asia. As well as being illegally poached in the wild, tigers can still be legally farmed for their body parts in China. International trade in tiger parts is banned, but it’s a different story domestically, where there’s high demand for luxury rugs, tiger skin accessories, tiger bone wine and traditional medicines (which have never been shown to work).

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is one of the world’s most recognizable animals, intimately connected with strength and untamed nature. A symbol of nature’s wild places, significant in faiths and folktales of almost all civilizations, tigers inspire millions of people around the globe, from the monasteries in Bhutan to the catwalks of Milan. Sadly, tigers are on the brink of extinction. Just over a century ago, 100,000 wild tigers roamed across Asia. Today, fewer than 3,900 live in a mere four per cent of their historic range. The largest tiger population can now be found in India, home to half of all remaining wild tigers. Much of this decline has occurred in the past decade. Endangered  A wildlife species facing imminent extirpation or extinction. 100 – 300 kg 2 - 3 metres Approximately 3,900 individuals Tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of 11 countries in Asia A tiger's roar can be heard as far as 3 kilometres. These beautiful, powerful cats inhabit diverse landscapes, from rainforests to grasslands, savannahs to mangrove forests and high-elevation habitats, so they play an important role in many ecosystems that supply nature and people with water, food and room to roam. As top predators in the food chain, tigers help keep their habitats balanced by preying on other animals, mainly herbivores. Too many herbivores would lead to overgrazing and degradation of the ecosystem. Tigers also drive economies. Where tigers exist, tourists go. And where tourists go, money can be made by communities with few alternatives for income. Tiger conservation projects help provide alternative livelihoods for rural communities. To safeguard tigers, we need to protect large swaths of forest across Asia where they live. By protecting these biologically diverse places, we can also preserve many other endangered species that live there. And, forests protected for tigers are known to store more carbon than other habitat types, helping to mitigate climate change. The most immediate threat to wild tigers is poaching. Their body parts are in relentless demand for traditional medicine and are status symbols within some Asian cultures. Resources for guarding protected areas where tigers live are usually limited. People and tigers increasingly compete for space. Tigers have lost 93 per cent of their historical range due to human activity and development. As forests shrink and prey becomes scarce, tigers are forced to hunt domestic livestock, which many local communities depend on for their livelihoods. In retaliation, tigers are killed or captured. These “conflict tigers” are commonly sold on the black market. We can’t lose our tigers. Your support makes a big difference towards our work to help recover tiger populations.

 Tigers are the largest felines in the world and as such, many cultures consider the tiger to be a symbol of strength, courage and dignity. The tiger is one of the twelve Chinese zodiac animals, and those born in the "Year of the Tiger" are thought to be brave, competitive and self-confident. However, because hunting them is also a sign of bravery in some cultures, tigers are endangered. Tigers are hunted for their meat, pelt and body parts that are used in folk remedies. To make matters worse, these great cats have lost most of their habitat due to logging, road building and development, according to  . Experts estimate there are no more than 3,200 tigers left in the wild. Most tigers have the characteristic orange fur with black or brown stripes, but these markings vary between subspecies. For example, the very large Siberian tiger has pale orange fur with few stripes, while the smaller Sumatran tigers in the Sunda Islands have dark, thickly striped fur. No two tigers have the same markings, and their stripes are as individual as fingerprints are for humans. In the wild, a tiger's stripes are important for survival, as they act as camouflage, appearing as moving shadows in long grass and in trees, according to  . The white Bengal tigers seen in some zoos are the result of a recessive gene, and are not albinos. In fact, it's unlikely that true albino tigers (with pink eyes) exist. Some historical reports detail tigers with black fur and tan stripes, caused by excessive pigmentation, but these accounts are extremely rare. On the backs of each ear, tigers have a white spot of fur, called ocelli, according to  . It's likely the spots act as fake eyes and they may also help tigers communicate with one another. A tiger's hind legs are longer than its front legs, allowing it to jump up to 32.5 feet (10 meters), according to  . Tiger claws are up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) long, and are used to grab and hold onto their prey. The largest tiger subspecies, the Siberian, also called Amur, are 10.75 feet (3.3 m) long and weigh up to 660 pounds (300 kilograms), according to  . The smallest tiger is the Sumatran, which weighs 165 - 308 pounds (74 - 139 kg), according to the   (WWF). Tigers also have very long tails, which can add around 3 feet (one m) to their overall length, according to  . Wild tigers live in Asia. Larger subspecies, such as the Siberian tiger, tend to live in northern, colder areas, such as eastern Russia and northeastern China. Smaller subspecies live in southern, warmer countries, such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. Depending on the subspecies, tigers live in a variety of environments, including arid forests, flooded mangrove forests, tropical forests and taiga (a cold forest with coniferous trees), according to the  . All tigers are carnivores. Most of a tiger's diet consists of large prey, such as pigs, deer, rhinos or elephant calves. To kill their prey, tigers clamp down on the animal's neck with their jaws and suffocate the animal. The tiger's canine teeth have pressure-sensing nerves, so it knows exactly where to deliver a fatal bite to its prey, according to the WWF. Though tigers are fierce hunters, they are no strangers to failure, as they are successful in only 10% of their hunts, according to  . Tigers are solitary creatures; they like to spend most of their time alone, roaming their massive territories looking for food. According to the  , the Siberian tiger has the largest range; its territory spans more than 4,000 square miles (10,000 square km). Tigers mark their territory by spraying a mix of urine and scent gland secretions onto trees and rocks. They also scratch marks into trees with their claws. Tiger babies are born helpless. At birth, a cub weighs 2.2 pounds (1 kg), and a female may have as many as seven cubs at a time, according to the  . Around half of all cubs don't live beyond the age of two, according to  . The mother must leave the cubs while she hunts, leaving them open to other predators. Most tiger mothers are unable to kill enough prey to feed a large litter, so some cubs may die of starvation. At just 8 weeks old, tiger cubs are ready to learn how to hunt and go out on hunting expeditions with their mother. At 2 years old, the cubs will set out on their own, and their mother will be ready for another set of cubs. In the wild, tigers typically live 10 to 15 years, according to  . For many years, scientists classified tigers into  : six living subspecies and three extinct ones. But in recent years, some researchers have challenged the traditional classification. A 2015 study published in the journal   argued that there are only two subspecies of tigers. However, a study published in the journal   in 2018 presented genomic evidence supporting six genetically distinct subspecies of tigers:the Bengal tiger ( ), the Amur tiger ( ), the South China tiger ( ), the Sumatran tiger ( ), the Indochinese tiger ( ), and the Malayan tiger ( ). The Javan tiger was last recorded in the 1970s, the Caspian tiger was lost in the 1950s, and the Bali tiger became extinct in the 1930s, according to  , a wild-cat conservation organization. There are more tigers in captivity than there are in the wild. According to the  , there are about 5,000 captive tigers in the United States alone, but there are fewer than 3,200 tigers in the wild. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN's) Red List of Threatened Species categorizes the  ,   and   tigers as endangered, and the  ,   and   Tigers as critically endangered. Most remaining tigers live on wildlife refuges to protect them from poachers. Poaching is by far the biggest threat facing tigers today. Illegal demand for tiger bones (used in tonics and medicines), tiger skin (seen as a status symbol) and other body parts, is driving the killing and trafficking, which has had an overwhelming impact on tiger populations and resulted in localized extinctions, according to  . The continued demand for tiger parts is pushing the species closer and closer to extinction. In addition to the threat of poaching, only 7% of the tiger's original range remains due to human agriculture, logging, settlements and roads.

New York,
NY 10036.  Early one Saturday morning in June, locals in the village of Semji in Bhutan reported the death of one of their cows grazing on the edge of the village. Claw marks on the cow´s neck and large paw prints in the mud pointed to a tiger as the culprit.  Semji, like several other villages in central Bhutan’s Trongsa District, has a tiger problem. Since 2016, tigers have killed more than 600 cattle, including 137 this year.   “In recent times, and probably as a result of climate change, tigers have been coming closer to villages to use the same waterholes as the locals.”   A new project is helping to maintain that equilibrium. The 2020-2023  programme, financed by the Government of Luxembourg and led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in partnership with the Royal Government of Bhutan and its Tiger Center, is aiming to understand the impact of climate change on  tigers, local communities and human-tiger conflicts.  “  seeks solutions to mitigate these conflicts, and is implementing various pilot solutions on the ground, for example, to address the immediate impacts of human-wildlife conflict by creating sustainable compensation mechanisms for villages affected by tiger predation,” says Matthias Jurek, a UNEP mountain ecosystems expert. Bhutan has an estimated 103 Bengal tigers spread around the country, from sub-tropical plains to temperate forests, to high-altitude alpine meadows. The country provides a critical link between tiger populations in Nepal and northeastern India, helping to keep populations connected and genetic diversity strong. More than 50 per cent of Bhutan is national parks and biological corridors, while the country’s constitution requires the government to maintain a minimum forest cover of 60 per cent “for eternity”. These protections, which experts call unparalleled, have led to an increase in wildlife populations.  But, climate change is making conservation a challenge. Like other Himalayan countries, Bhutan has seen rising temperatures and the formation of large lakes from glacier melt. Meanwhile, rainfall levels are more unpredictable, making farming tricky.  All these changes are placing pressure on humans and wildlife, changing the way they interact.  Through the Vanishing Treasures, programme researchers set up 70 camera traps in forests and other habitats, giving them and park managers a peek into the little-seen world of Bhutan’s tigers.  This will help them catalogue where tigers live and what they hunt, estimate their numbers, and track individuals.  At the community level, Vanishing Treasures is conducting surveys to better understand how locals generate money. Electric fences to protect livestock, efforts to improve grasslands, and the introduction of high-yielding cattle breeds—all of which should be starting this year—are designed to benefit local livelihoods. The goal of the project is to improve livelihoods and work with local communities to protect tigers. Bhutan has a special relationship with the Bengal Tiger ( ). As early as the eighth century, this majestic cat was associated with divinities. To celebrate this year’s International Tiger Day on 29 July, the district of Trongsa, supported by the  , is hosting celebrations which will be attended by the district governor, and representatives of the Ministry of  Agriculture and Forests and the Department of Forests and Park Services. The event will see the launch of  a book about tigers for schoolchildren, the distribution of tiger posters, and a cultural programme. Token goodwill compensation payments ranging from US$65 to US$25 per head of cattle will be paid to farmers who lost livestock to tigers in 2020.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. By now, it seems almost everyone with a Netflix account has watched "Tiger King" — or at least seen the memes. But for a docu-series that takes place at multiple animal parks and literally has the word "tiger" in the title, it didn't tell fans much about, uh, actual tigers or their conservation.  Given the lack of tournament preparation, it doesn't say much for  ' confidence in his own body that he is not in Memphis, Tennessee, this week in advance of next week's PGA Championship. Sure, there are other compelling explanations to skip the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational, chief among them the fact that he has never seen the TPC Southwind course. Throw in the sweltering heat, good chances for thunderstorms (and delays) and the extreme temperature difference between Memphis and San Francisco the following week for the PGA Championship, and there are plenty of good reasons to take it easy this week, work on the game at home, and be fully ready for the delayed first major of 2020. As Woods said on Friday in announcing that he would be skipping the WGC, he is "doing what I think is best to prepare for the PGA Championship and upcoming FedEx Cup playoffs.'' Answer questions on the PGA Championship for a chance to win $5,000!  Fair enough. Woods knows better than anyone how his body is reacting these days, and the parts of his game that need work. But it is nonetheless telling that he is not competing, especially when you consider he has just four tournament rounds to his name since February -- and plenty of competitive rust still showing. Woods has always been a big supporter of the World Golf Championship events, rarely skipping them when healthy, save for a few Match Play misses over the years. Woods has said many times he appreciates the PGA Tour's efforts in securing these big-money events. And he has won 18 of them. Eight of those came at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, where he dominated the Firestone Country Club course. And eight times he played that tournament the week before the PGA Championship -- the only major as a pro in which has played the week prior -- so there was precedent for him to do so. And yet, he took a pass, despite some of the flaws in his game and the lack of preparation. It's easy to second-guess now, but perhaps one of the earlier events (RBC Heritage or Travelers?) in the PGA Tour's restart from the   would have made sense, especially given the possibility of skipping the WGC. Consecutive events is always going to be dicey for Woods, but given his rather lackluster performance at the Memorial, where he twice shot 76 and tied for 40th, it might have been understood. Of course, the second-round 76 was due in large part to back stiffness that was obvious. Woods could not hide his discomfort, and the shot patterns -- he missed seven tee shots to the right in the second round -- along with several awkward or one-handed swings were clues. So Woods has some work to do this week to get ready for the PGA, which will be played at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, a venue where he has had success. Woods won the 2005 WGC-American Express Invitational there in 2005 in a playoff over John Daly. And at the 2009 Presidents Cup, he went 5-0. But those events were a long time ago. "I competed and played again,'' he said after the final round at the Memorial. "It's been a while. It was nice to get my feet wet and compete again. Tough, tough conditions to start out my first week back. But it was good to get the feel and the flow of competing again.'' That sounds great if it followed his first event of the year in January, with a slow buildup to the Masters. But Tiger has some ground to cover this week, and here are a few things to keep in mind. Woods is scrutinized like no other and often judged by his own lofty standards and expectations. With a bit of perspective, his showing at the Memorial was decent, if not great, but far from awful. He returned at Muirfield Village on the most difficult setup to date of the revised schedule, on a course that played like a major championship over the weekend. That was no simple foray back into golf. Perhaps most impressive: Woods was tied for sixth in strokes gained approach to the green and tied for 18th in greens in regulation with 62.5%. The man can still hit his irons with the best of them. That is always important in a major championship. Anecdotally and statistically, Woods' swing speed was less than it has been, which is both good and bad. It's good in that he is no longer swinging so violently. There were plenty of long tee shots, well over 300 yards, and on the weekend especially, the swing looked smooth. The lack of speed could be by design or because he was being careful. Given all the time away for Woods, it was a bit surprising to see some of those numbers decrease. In 2018, Woods averaged 178 mph ball speed; it was mostly under 170 at the Memorial and his average carry was less than 280 yards. But it's not necessarily a negative, unless other parts of his game are not good. Woods was a mediocre 42nd in strokes gained off the tee, meaning he was giving up ground to the field. His driving accuracy was 55%, which is so-so but needs to be better, especially since many of the misses were with clubs other than the driver. This is one of those confounding things about Tiger's game. Statistically, he often hits the ball closer to the hole compared to his peers from 180 yards than he does from 100. That's the key to par-5 scoring, and Woods was just 1 under for the week at Muirfield Village. He also hit just 75% of the greens from 100 to 125 yards. This has to improve, and Tiger said so himself. "I didn't feel comfortable playing break,'' Woods said. "I've been in Florida playing Bermuda [greens] and seeing minimal break. Come out here and playing 10, 12 feet of break was a bit different and something I'm going to have to get used to.'' Understandable, really. It's not like Tiger has been playing a bevy of courses at home. At the Memorial, he was 56th in strokes gained putting, losing ground to the field. He also missed several short ones. All of that can be cleaned up. The good news for Woods is Harding Park does not have the traditional California poa annua greens that sometimes give him fits. (Think Riviera, for example.) They are bent grass, like the surface at Muirfield Village and Augusta National. Woods plays on Bermuda at home, but those are typically up to tour-level speeds. Bent can be faster, but it's generally smooth, exactly how he likes it. It would make sense for Woods to get to Harding Park early, perhaps this weekend, to get to work on learning those greens. It almost sounds silly, but a golfer has to learn how to walk when he hasn't been playing tournament golf. Woods undoubtedly played plenty of golf at his home course, the Medalist in South Florida, but there is scant evidence that he did much walking. His caddie, Joe LaCava -- who often prods him to do this when he is around -- was not summoned to Florida prior to Woods' return. Most of the golf was done out of cart, and that makes sense on some levels. Woods wants to work on his game, and zipping around allows for more time to get on the range and get in the gym. But there is still something to be said for going through the motions of hitting a drive, walking to the ball, hitting an approach, walking to the green ... and never sitting down. Think about it. That is virtually how every round of golf on tour is played, with perhaps a time or two when Woods sits on his bag while play has slowed down. It takes getting used to that rhythm, and standing for long periods of time and walking more than 5 miles in extreme heat takes a toll -- not to mention is cause for a stiff back. Harding Park is not a strenuous walk, and the temperatures won't climb much above the low 70s. But it is something to watch. Woods has rarely gone into a major championship with so little tournament preparation, with a few notable exceptions. He will go to Harding Park having played just one of the previous eight weeks in the tour's restart. That puts him well behind almost every other top player, save for Adam Scott, who has not played during the restart. Throw in the lack of action for Woods since he played the Genesis Invitational -- and he has played just one of the past 11 events. In 2015, Woods took off nine weeks due to chipping and back woes following a withdrawal from the Farmers Insurance Open. He started that year with a missed cut and then the WD and didn't play again until the Masters, where he tied for 17th. In 2011, Woods suffered Achilles and knee injuries at the Masters, withdrew after nine holes of the Players Championship, then didn't play again until the WGC-Bridgestone in August, the week prior to the PGA, where he missed the cut. In 2010, Woods did not play at all until the Masters in the aftermath of his personal issues. That he managed to tie for fourth -- he opened with a 68 -- and was in contention on the final day was a remarkable achievement given all that swirled around him at the time. In 2008, Woods did not play between the Masters and U.S. Open, undergoing what was supposed to be a minor knee procedure but leading to small fractures in the bone of his left leg and an eventual ACL replacement. He won the U.S. Open despite all those issues. Bottom line, throughout his career, Woods has had far more tournament preparation going into a major than he has now. Woods referenced the FedEx Cup playoffs in his tweet announcing he would not play this week. If he is intent on getting to Atlanta for the Tour Championship, he has some work to do, and it will be interesting to see how he attempts to handle it. Following the 3M Open, Woods dropped to 45th in the FedEx Cup standings (and to 15th in the Official World Golf Ranking) and is likely to drop further after missing the WGC this week. That means he could use a good week at the PGA Championship to move closer to the top 30, which will be needed for him to make it to Atlanta. Here's the problem Woods faces: The first playoff event, the Northern Trust at TPC-Boston, is just two weeks after the PGA. That event has a 36-hole cut. It's unlikely he would play three straight weeks in the playoffs, so does he sit out the Northern Trust and wait for the top 70 at the BMW? If so, he might put himself in a position where he is too far behind and in need of a big finish. So does he instead go to Boston with hopes of sitting out Chicago? Or does he consider playing both and taking his chances on a third straight week in Atlanta if he makes it? Tough decisions. After all, the rescheduled U.S. Open is just two weeks after the Tour Championship. Woods needs to play, but he doesn't want to play too much. Woods is undoubtedly not concerned about that now.

A university differs from a college in that it is usually larger, has a broader curriculum, and offers graduate and professional degrees in addition to undergraduate degrees. Although universities did not arise in the West until the   in Europe, they existed in some parts of Asia and Africa in ancient times. The modern Western university evolved from the   schools known as  ; they were generally recognized places of study open to students from all parts of  . The earliest   arose out of efforts to educate clerks and   beyond the level of the cathedral and   schools.

The earliest Western institution that can be called a university was a famous medical school that arose at  ,  , in the 9th century and drew students from all over Europe. It remained merely a medical school, however. The first true university in the West was founded at   late in the 11th century. It became a widely respected school of   and  . The first university to arise in northern Europe was the  , founded between 1150 and 1170. It became noted for its   of  , and it served as a model for other universities in northern Europe such as the   in England, which was well established by the end of the 12th century. The Universities of Paris and Oxford were composed of colleges, which were actually endowed   halls for scholars. These early universities were corporations of students and masters, and they eventually received their charters from  ,  , and  . The  , founded by Emperor   (1224), was the first to be established under imperial authority, while the University of Toulouse, founded by Pope   (1229), was the first to be established by papal decree. These universities were free to govern themselves, provided they taught neither   nor  . Students and masters together elected their own rectors (presidents). As the   of independence, however, universities had to   themselves. So teachers charged fees, and, to assure themselves of a livelihood, they had to please their students. These early universities had no permanent buildings and little corporate  , and they were subject to the loss of dissatisfied students and masters who could migrate to another   and establish a place of study there. The history of the   began in 1209 when a number of disaffected students moved there from Oxford, and 20 years later Oxford profited by a migration of students from the University of Paris. From the 13th century on, universities were established in many of the principal cities of Europe. Universities were founded at Montpellier (beginning of the 13th century) and Aix-en-Provence (1409) in  , at   (1222),   (1303), and   (1321) in Italy, at   (1218) in  , at Prague (1348) and   (1365) in central Europe, at   (1386),   (1409), Freiburg (1457), and   (1477) in what is now  , at Louvain (1425) in present-day  , and at   (1411) and   (1451) in Scotland. Until the end of the 18th century, most Western universities offered a core curriculum based on the seven liberal arts:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Students then proceeded to study under one of the professional faculties of  ,  , and theology. Final examinations were grueling, and many students failed. The     of the 16th century and the ensuing   affected the universities of Europe in different ways. In the German states, new Protestant universities were founded and older schools were taken over by Protestants, while many   universities became staunch defenders of the traditional   associated with the Catholic church. By the 17th century, both Protestant and Catholic universities had become overly devoted to defending correct   and hence remained resistant to the new interest in   that had begun to sweep through Europe. The new learning was discouraged, and thus many universities underwent a period of relative decline. New schools continued to be founded during this time, however, including ones at Edinburgh (1583), Leiden (1575), and Strasbourg (university status, 1621). The first modern university in Europe was that of  , founded by   in 1694. This school was one of the first to renounce religious orthodoxy of any kind in favour of rational and objective   inquiry, and it was the first where teachers lectured in   (i.e., a   language) rather than in  . Halle’s   were adopted by the   (founded 1737) a generation later and subsequently by most German and many American universities. In the later 18th and 19th centuries   was gradually displaced as the dominant force as European universities became institutions of modern learning and research and were secularized in their curriculum and administration. These trends were typified by the   (1809), in which   experimentation replaced conjecture; theological, philosophical, and other traditional doctrines were examined with a new rigour and objectivity; and modern standards of   were pioneered. The German model of the university as a complex of graduate schools performing advanced research and experimentation proved to have a worldwide influence.

 The word   is derived from the    , which roughly means "community of teachers and scholars".  The modern university system has roots in the European  , which was created in Italy and evolved from   for the   during the  . 
 The original   word   refers in general to "a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild,  , etc".  At the time of the emergence of urban town life and    , specialized "associations of   and   with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located" came to be denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members. 
 In modern usage the word has come to mean  "  with the earlier emphasis on its corporate organization considered as applying historically to Medieval universities. 
 The original Latin word referred to degree-awarding institutions of learning in   and  , where this form of legal organisation was prevalent and from where the institution spread around the world.
 An important idea in the definition of a university is the notion of  . The first documentary evidence of this comes from early in the life of the  , which adopted an academic charter, the  ,  in 1158 or 1155,  which guaranteed the right of a traveling scholar to unhindered passage in the interests of education. Today this is claimed as the origin of "academic freedom".  This is now widely recognised internationally - on 18 September 1988, 430 university rectors signed the  ,  marking the 900th anniversary of Bologna's foundation. The number of universities signing the   continues to grow, drawing from all parts of the world.
 According to  , the earliest universities were founded in Asia and Africa, predating the first European  .  Scholars occassionally call the University of Al Quaraouiyine (name given in 1963), founded in Morocco by Fatima al-Fihri in 859, a university,  although Jacques Verger writes that this is done out of scholarly convenience.  Several scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin was founded  and run  as a   until after World War II. They date the transformation of the madrasa of al-Qarawiyyin into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.  In the wake of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed "University of Al Quaraouiyine" two years later. 
 Some scholars, including Makdisi, have argued that early medieval universities were influenced by the madrasas in  , the  , and the Middle East during the  .  Norman Daniel, however, views this argument as overstated.  Roy Lowe and Yoshihito Yasuhara have recently drawn on the well-documented influences of scholarship from the Islamic world on the universities of Western Europe to call for a reconsideration of the development of higher education, turning away from a concern with local institutional structures to a broader consideration within a global context. 
 The university is generally regarded as a formal institution that has its origin in the   tradition.  European higher education took place for hundreds of years in   or   ( ), in which   and   taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century.  The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the   by   as   and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception.  Later they were also founded by Kings ( ,  ,  ) or municipal administrations ( ,  ). In the  , most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by  .    was critical in promoting and regulating the concept of modern university as his   ordered the regulated establishment of cathedral schools that transformed themselves into the first European universities. 
 The first universities in Europe with a form of corporate/guild structure were the   (1088), the   (c.1150, later associated with the  ), and the   (1167).
 The University of Bologna began as a law school teaching the   or   of peoples which was in demand across Europe for those defending the right of incipient nations against empire and church. Bologna's special claim to   is based on its autonomy, its awarding of degrees, and other structural arrangements, making it the oldest continuously operating institution  independent of kings, emperors or any kind of direct religious authority. 
 The conventional date of 1088, or 1087 according to some,  records when   commences teaching   6th-century codification of Roman law, the  , recently discovered at Pisa. Lay students arrived in the city from many lands entering into a contract to gain this knowledge, organising themselves into 'Nationes', divided between that of the Cismontanes and that of the Ultramontanes. The students "had all the power … and dominated the masters". 
 In Europe, young men proceeded to university when they had completed their study of the  –the preparatory arts of  ,   and   or  –and the  :  ,  ,  , and  .
 All over Europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a European thirst for knowledge, and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions. Princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends. The emergence of humanism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient Greek texts. 
 The rediscovery of  's works–more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated–fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century. Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history.  Richard Dales, for instance, calls the discovery of Aristotle's works "a turning point in the history of Western thought."  After Aristotle re-emerged, a community of scholars, primarily communicating in Latin, accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity, and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world, with those of the church. The efforts of this " " were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason. This became the primary mission of lecturers, and the expectation of students.
 The university culture developed differently in northern Europe than it did in the south, although the northern (primarily Germany, France and  ) and southern universities (primarily Italy) did have many elements in common. Latin was the language of the university, used for all texts, lectures,   and examinations. Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic,  , and  ; while  ,  , and   were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology. There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception of degrees in theology, for which the doctorate was more common. Italian universities awarded primarily doctorates. The distinction can be attributed to the intent of the degree holder after graduation – in the north the focus tended to be on acquiring teaching positions, while in the south students often went on to professional positions.  The structure of northern universities tended to be modeled after the system of faculty governance developed at the  . Southern universities tended to be patterned after the student-controlled model begun at the University of Bologna.  Among the southern universities, a further distinction has been noted between those of northern Italy, which followed the pattern of Bologna as a "self-regulating, independent corporation of scholars" and those of southern Italy and Iberia, which were "founded by royal and imperial charter to serve the needs of government." 
 During the   (approximately late 15th century to 1800), the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth, productivity and innovative research. At the end of the Middle Ages, about 400 years after the first European university was founded, there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe. In the 15th century, twenty-eight new ones were created, with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625.  This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe, with the highest concentrations in the German Empire (34), Italian countries (26), France (25), and Spain (23) – this was close to a 500% increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages. This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared, or institutions that merged with other universities during this time.  The identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period, as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions. In fact, the term "university" was not always used to designate a higher education institution. In  , the term   was still often used, while "Academy" was common in Northern European countries. 
 The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the  , disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times.  ,  ,  ,  , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts.  This era was also affected by the rise of the  . As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state. 
 Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris, where student members are controlled by faculty "masters", provided a standard for universities, the application of this model took at least three different forms. There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum; this model tended to train specialists. There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at   where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature. There were also universities that combined these models, using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization. 
 Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages:  , logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, law, grammar and  . Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated.  Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the  . Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives.  Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts.  Professors of medicine such as  ,   and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts. The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship. For instance,   was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation of Galen, whose ideas he verified through his own dissections. In law, Andreas Alciatus infused the   with a humanist perspective, while   humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist.   cited the works of   as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts, which was important for the reform at Protestant universities.   , who taught at the Universities of   and  , and  , who taught at the   (as did Melanchthon), also had humanist training. The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs, syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship. 
 Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery, exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university, and the ideas of those texts into society generally, their influence was ultimately quite progressive. The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate (as the notable list of scholars above attests to). A focus on knowledge coming from self, from the human, has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction, and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities. This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts, but also their adaptation and expansion. For instance, Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen, but he also invigorated this text with experimentation, disagreements and further research.  The propagation of these texts, especially within the universities, was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular, which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices. 
 Examining the influence of humanism on scholars in medicine, mathematics, astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution. Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confines of the university, the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature of science during the  . Historians such as   have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists.  This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors, usually in princely courts, and associations with newly forming scientific societies. 
 Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science. In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the   were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts.  It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction.  Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities.  Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources. 
 Regardless of the way the tension between universities, individual scientists, and the scientific revolution itself is perceived, there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed. Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction, but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting. The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines. Instead of entering higher education to become a "general scholar" immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum, there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself. The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge. 
 The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities of research during this time, as individual scientists, associations and universities were vying for limited resources. There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public, or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities.  Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors, and the university provided foundational training and authority for the research and conclusions, they could not compete with the resources available through private benefactors. 
 By the end of the early modern period, the structure and orientation of higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context. Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging. The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture, and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state.
 By the 18th century, universities published their own   and by the 19th century, the German and the French university models had arisen. The German, or Humboldtian model, was conceived by   and based on  's liberal ideas pertaining to the importance of  ,  , and   in universities.  The French university model involved strict discipline and control over every aspect of the university.
 Until the 19th century,   played a significant role in university curriculum; however, the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century, and by the end of the 19th century, the German university model had spread around the world. Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries and became increasingly accessible to the masses. In the United States, the   was the first to adopt the (German)   model; this pioneered the adoption by most other American universities.  In Britain, the move from   to   saw the arrival of new civic universities with an emphasis on   and  , a movement initiated in 1960 by Sir Keith Murray (chairman of the University Grants Committee) and  , with the formation of the  .  The British also established universities worldwide, and   became available to the masses not only in Europe.
 In 1963, the   on universities in the United Kingdom concluded that such institutions should have four main "objectives essential to any properly balanced system: instruction in skills; the promotion of the general powers of the mind so as to produce not mere specialists but rather cultivated men and women; to maintain research in balance with teaching, since teaching should not be separated from the advancement of learning and the search for truth; and to transmit a common culture and common standards of citizenship." 
 In the early 21st century, concerns were raised over the increasing managerialisation and standardisation of universities worldwide. Neo-liberal management models have in this sense been critiqued for creating "corporate universities (where) power is transferred from faculty to managers, economic justifications dominate, and the familiar 'bottom line' eclipses pedagogical or intellectual concerns".  Academics' understanding of time, pedagogical pleasure, vocation, and collegiality have been cited as possible ways of alleviating such problems. 
 A   is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state. Some national universities are closely associated with national  ,   or   aspirations, for instance the  , which formed partly from the   which was created almost immediately and specifically in answer to the non-denominational universities which had been set up in Ireland in 1850. In the years leading up to the  , and in no small part a result of the Gaelic Romantic revivalists, the NUI collected a large amount of information on the   and  .  Reforms in Argentina were the result of the   of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic  higher education system.
 Universities created by bilateral or multilateral treaties between states are  . An example is the  , which offers training in European law to lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics.   is chartered as a university and umbrella organisation dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries, and the   engages in efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are of concern to the United Nations, its peoples and member states. The  , a post-graduate university specialised in the social sciences, is officially an intergovernmental organisation, set up by the member states of the  .
 Although each institution is organized differently, nearly all universities have a board of trustees; a president,  , or  ; at least one vice president, vice-chancellor, or vice-rector; and deans of various divisions. Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments, schools or  .   systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards . They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system. They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs. In addition, they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country. However, many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial, research and   autonomy.   are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies. However, they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances.
 The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world. In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state, while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay. In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town, while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world, and may provide university accommodation for their students. 
 The definition of a university varies widely, even within some countries.  Where there is clarification, it is usually set by a government agency.  For example:
 In Australia, the   (TEQSA) is Australia's independent national regulator of the higher education sector.  Students rights within university are also protected by the Education Services for Overseas Students Act (ESOS).
 In the United States there is no nationally standardized definition for the term  , although the term has traditionally been used to designate   and was once reserved for doctorate-granting research institutions. Some states, such as  , will only grant a school "university status" if it grants at least two  . 
 In the United Kingdom, the   is responsible for approving the use of the word   in the name of an institution, under the terms of the  . 
 In India, a new designation   has been created for institutions of higher education that are not universities, but work at a very high standard in a specific area of study ("An Institution of Higher Education, other than universities, working at a very high standard in specific area of study, can be declared by the Central Government on the advice of the   as an Institution 'Deemed-to-be-university'"). Institutions that are 'deemed-to-be-university' enjoy the academic status and the privileges of a university.  Through this provision many schools that are commercial in nature and have been established just to exploit the demand for higher education have sprung up. 
 In Canada,   generally refers to a two-year, non-degree-granting institution, while   connotes a four-year, degree-granting institution. Universities may be sub-classified (as in the  ) into large research universities with many PhD-granting programs and medical schools (for example,  ); "comprehensive" universities that have some PhDs but are not geared toward research (such as  ); and smaller, primarily undergraduate universities (such as  ).
 In Germany, universities are institutions of higher education which have the power to confer bachelor, master and PhD degrees. They are explicitly recognised as such by law and cannot be founded without government approval. The term Universität (i.e. the German term for university) is protected by law and any use without official approval is a criminal offense. Most of them are public institutions, though a few private universities exist. Such universities are always research universities. Apart from these universities, Germany has other institutions of higher education (Hochschule,  ). Fachhochschule means a higher education institution which is similar to the former   in the British education system, the English term used for these German institutions is usually 'university of applied sciences'. They can confer master's degrees but no PhDs. They are similar to the model of   with less research and the research undertaken being highly practical. Hochschule can refer to various kinds of institutions, often specialised in a certain field (e.g. music, fine arts, business). They might or might not have the power to award PhD degrees, depending on the respective government legislation. If they award PhD degrees, their rank is considered equivalent to that of universities proper (Universität), if not, their rank is equivalent to universities of applied sciences.
 Colloquially, the term   may be used to describe a phase in one's life: "When I was at university..." (in the United States and Ireland,   is often used instead: "When I was in college..."). In Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the  ,   is often contracted to  . In Ghana, New Zealand, Bangladesh and in South Africa it is sometimes called "varsity" (although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years).  "Varsity" was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century.  "Varsity" is still in common usage in Scotland. 
 In many countries, students are required to pay tuition fees.
Many students look to get 'student grants' to cover the cost of university. In 2016, the average outstanding student loan balance per borrower in the United States was US$30,000.  In many U.S. states, costs are anticipated to rise for students as a result of decreased state funding given to public universities. 
 There are several major exceptions on tuition fees. In many European countries, it is possible to study without tuition fees. Public universities in   were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005. Denmark, Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students. Citizens of   and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees, and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact.  The situation in Germany is similar; public universities usually do not charge tuition fees apart from a small administrative fee. For degrees of a postgraduate professional level sometimes tuition fees are levied. Private universities, however, almost always charge tuition fees.
 The Quaraouiyine Mosque, founded in 859, is the most famous mosque of Morocco and attracted continuous investment by Muslim rulers. As for the nature of its curriculum, it was typical of other major madrasahs such as al-Azhar and Al Quaraouiyine, though many of the texts used at the institution came from Muslim Spain...Al Quaraouiyine began its life as a small mosque constructed in 859 C.E. by means of an endowment bequeathed by a wealthy woman of much piety, Fatima bint Muhammed al-Fahri. The Adjustments of Original Institutions of the Higher Learning: the Madrasah. Significantly, the institutional adjustments of the madrasahs affected both the structure and the content of these institutions. In terms of structure, the adjustments were twofold: the reorganization of the available original madaris and the creation of new institutions. This resulted in two different types of Islamic teaching institutions in al-Maghrib. The first type was derived from the fusion of old madaris with new universities. For example, Morocco transformed Al-Qarawiyin (859 A.D.) into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education in 1963. Higher education has always been an integral part of Morocco, going back to the ninth century when the Karaouine Mosque was established. The  , known today as Al Qayrawaniyan University, became part of the state university system in 1947. , in modern usage, the name of an institution of learning where the Islamic sciences are taught, i.e. a college for higher studies, as opposed to an elementary school of traditional type ( ); in mediaeval usage, essentially a college of   in which the other  , including literary and philosophical ones, were ancillary subjects only. A   is a college of  . The madrasa was an educational institution in which Islamic law ( ) was taught according to one or more   rites:  ,  ,  , or  . It was supported by an endowment or charitable trust ( ) that provided for at least one chair for one professor of law, income for other faculty or staff, scholarships for students, and funds for the maintenance of the building. Madrasas contained lodgings for the professor and some of his students. Subjects other than law were frequently taught in madrasas, and even   seances were held in them, but there could be no madrasa without law as technically the major subject. In studying an institution which is foreign and remote in point of time, as is the case of the medieval madrasa, one runs the double risk of attributing to it characteristics borrowed from one's own institutions and one's own times. Thus gratuitous transfers may be made from one culture to the other, and the time factor may be ignored or dismissed as being without significance. One cannot therefore be too careful in attempting a comparative study of these two institutions: the   and the  . But in spite of the pitfalls inherent in such a study, albeit sketchy, the results which may be obtained are well worth the risks involved. In any case, one cannot avoid making comparisons when certain unwarranted statements have already been made and seem to be currently accepted without question. The most unwarranted of these statements is the one which makes of the "madrasa" a "university".  is the oldest university in  . It was founded as a   in   in the middle of the ninth century. It has been a destination for students and scholars of   and Arabic studies throughout the history of Morocco. There were also other religious schools like the madras of ibn yusuf and other schools in the sus. This system of basic education called al-ta'lim al-aSil was funded by the sultans of Morocco and many famous traditional families. After independence, al-qarawiyin maintained its reputation, but it seemed important to transform it into a university that would prepare   for a modern country while maintaining an emphasis on Islamic studies. Hence, al-qarawiyin university was founded in February 1963 and, while the  's residence was kept in Fès, the new university initially had four   located in major regions of the country known for their religious influences and  . These colleges were kuliyat al-shari's in Fès, kuliyat uSul al-din in  , kuliyat al-lugha al-'arabiya in   (all founded in 1963), and kuliyat al-shari'a in Ait Melloul near  , which was founded in 1979.

A Black student says she got a lukewarm response from both her London, Ont., university and her white professor after he used the N-word in class with no warning.   Tamia Chicas said the incident happened in an October class at King's University College, which is affiliated with Western University. Prof. Coby Dowdell was discussing the book  by Joseph Conrad when he used the word in a quote. His class explores racism in historical literature and looks at the ethical responsibilities of studying such works. Chicas said Dowdell never warned her or, apparently, anyone else the racial slur would be used in class. "I was shocked because I was the only Black student in that English class," Chicas said. "I think a lot of other people were caught off guard too, because everyone kind of went silent and then everyone turned to look at me." "I felt embarrassed. I don't know why. I was sad obviously and uncomfortable. I stopped showing up to that class after that happened." At the time,   in which a Black student took exception to her white professor using the same epithet in class.  A   said the school has "a deeply entrenched anti-Black legacy that remains pervasive — evident to those who live it, but hidden from, willfully ignored, or denied by those who don't."  Chicas says she stopped going to class and complained — first to Michael Milde, Western's dean of arts and humanities, who referred Chicas to Laura Melnyk-Gribble, the acting vice-principal and academic dean at King's.  Chicas said she met separately with Melnyk-Gribble and Dowdell to discuss what happened. But Chicas said she felt Melnyk-Gribble missed the point.  "She told me she was really good friends with [Dowdell] and he was a really good guy. That's fine. You can still be a good person, but as a white, male teacher you shouldn't be using that language knowing that it's not a good word to be using, especially because that course I was in was highlighting how racism affects Black people." Chicas says Dowdell's response also missed the mark.  "He told me he was given permission by a Black staff member to use the word and, in his opinion, he thought it was OK just because he was quoting from a book," she said. CBC News asked to speak to both Dowdell and Melnyk-Gribble but received a written statement instead, in which a King's spokeswoman said Dowdell has since apologized. "The professor realizes the harm he has caused by quoting Conrad's racist language," spokeswoman Jane Antoniak wrote in an email to CBC News. "[Dowdell] is deeply sorry that he quoted the texts using the full word. This word will not be used in full when the course is held again this fall." The statement said Dowdell "had brought forward Joseph Conrad as an example to help students think through historical racism and the ethical responsibilities of studying works of literature from the past." Western is looking to fix racial blindspots after its " " was identified in the June report.  The report made 23 recommendations, including the creation of an anti-racism task force, anti-racism training programs, support for people affected by racism on campus and the recruitment of more racialized students, faculty and staff.  It was commissioned after a student reported her professor's use of the N-word in class, which led to the student, who is Black, being the target of multiple racist comments online.  Chicas said she doubts the university will make campus a more harmonious place. She believes the reason her complaint went nowhere is because her professor and the dean are "good friends."  "There's no support from the dean. Obviously, I did not feel supported from [Melnyk-Gribble] because their issue is that they wanted to support one another." Chicas starts her third-year of a French and English double major at King's University College this fall and is anxious how her complaint and, moreover, the fact that she went to the media, might affect her grades. "I still have to take mandatory classes with him and I'm kind of nervous about how Western is dealing with that and whether there are any alternative classes I can take because obviously he's not going to be too pleased."
