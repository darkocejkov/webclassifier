   Think of an animal that roars.

   You thought of a lion, didn’t you? Nearly everybody does.

   Roaring lions are etched into our collective consciousness.
   They show up everywhere in popular culture.

   Lions are not the only big cats that can roar, though. Tigers,
   leopards, and jaguars all have impressive roars. But there’s
   something particularly bone-chilling about the tiger’s roar.

   In fact, during the production of Disney’s animated classic,
   The Lion King, the audio engineers felt that the lion roars
   they had recorded didn’t sound powerful enough. [9]They
   replaced them with tiger roars instead.

   A tiger’s roar is nearly as loud as a jet engine and can be
   heard two miles away. At 114 decibels, the roar of an adult
   tiger nearly crosses the threshold of pain and comes within
   spitting distance of levels that can cause permanent hearing
   loss.

   Scientists who study tigers have observed that a tiger’s roar
   has [11]a paralyzing effect on prey. The infrasounds a tiger
   can generate have been found to literally ‘scare’ some animals
   to death.

     [11] https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/12/001201152406.htm

   But while a tiger’s roar has the power to immobilize prey,
   tigers don’t typically use their roar when hunting. Like all
   the big cats, tigers stalk and pounce on their victims. Roaring
   runs the risk of alerting prey to their presence and scaring
   them away. Scientists have found that tigers roar when they are
   challenged, threatened, or afraid.

   For the most part, tigers roar at other tigers.
     __________________________________________________________

   The ‘tiger’ has roared at all of us.

   Visit any grocery store these days and you can see it in
   people’s eyes: they’re filled with depression, anxiety, and
   despair. Most people are absolutely paralyzed by fear.

   But don’t forget why the tiger roars.

   The tiger roars when it has met its match.

   Standing still and giving into fear is what prey does.

   Do you know what tigers do when another tiger roars at them?
   They roar back.

   Then, they stand up on their hind legs and lunge forward with
   every ounce of energy they possess.

   Now’s the time to do the same. Everyone has a tiger in front of
   them right now. It’s an opportunity to demonstrate who and what
   we are; to take action while others quiver in fear.

   For some, that may mean making more phone calls or sending more
   emails to drive new sales. For others, that may mean getting
   creative and trying different approaches to keep their business
   afloat in this challenging environment. And for many, it may
   mean sending out twice as many resumes and Linkedin messages to
   secure employment.

   Another interesting thing about tigers is that they don’t like
   it when people look them in the eye.

   In 1989, villagers in India were getting [14]killed by wild
   Bengal tigers daily. Guns, traps, and even explosives weren’t
   working — the attacks persisted.

     [14] https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/05/science/face-masks-fool-the-bengal-tigers.html

   After months of attempts to solve the problem, a curious
   student made a fascinating discovery: tigers only seemed to
   attack when they felt they weren’t being watched.

   People started being more vigilant — never showing their backs
   to the jungle — ready to stare down any tigers that came their
   way. Some even started making cheap human masks and wearing
   them on the backs of their heads. For three years straight, no
   villagers were killed by tigers except those that either
   refused to wear the masks or had taken them off.
     __________________________________________________________

   When we’re in the middle of serious problems, it can be
   tempting to do nothing. Nobody expects much from us when we’re
   struggling. It can even be hard to expect anything of
   ourselves. Avoiding or ignoring our problems altogether can
   seem like the better path.

   But it’s precisely at these moments, when the chips are down
   and we’ve taken a few licks, that we need to confront our
   problems head-on and fight the hardest.

   We tend to underestimate ourselves. The truth is that we’re all
   so much more capable than we give ourselves credit for. It’s
   amazing how much we can accomplish through unrelenting,
   concentrated effort. Our problems may not retreat completely
   the way those Bengals did in the 80s, but we can make
   measurable progress. Maybe we can only make things 1% better.
   But 1% better, every day, is [15]37 times better over the
   course of a year. Big results come from small, but consistent
   actions.

   The tiger has roared.

   We can’t change that and it does no good to wish things were
   different. Now is not the time to allow ourselves to be frozen
   by fear. There is only one sensible way to respond.

   Look that tiger right in the eye and roar back.
