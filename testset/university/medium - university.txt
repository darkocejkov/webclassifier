   The university has gotten a lot of bad press in recent years.
   Consider this video compilation where some of our society’s
   most successful people talk about higher education…

   I’d strongly suggest you listen to the entire video, as there
   are some fantastic points here. At one time, universities were
   attended by a fraction of the population and trained people to
   think for modern times. It was affordable for anyone and then
   graduating was a qualification by itself, where you were
   assured of a nice career.

   But times have changed. Consider all the weaknesses of the
   current system:
     * It’s absurdly expensive. In the USA, home to many of the
       world’s most prestigious universities, you regularly see
       $20–50k annual tuition costs. Education simply shouldn’t
       cost that much, which gives you the feeling that tuition is
       subsidizing non-learning campus activity.
     * Outcomes are not great anymore. In the USA, 50% of students
       are graduating into jobs that don’t require a college
       degree. So half of students are taking out life-changing
       debt levels for zero purpose.
     * Universities aren’t able to keep pace with societal trends
       and technology. Most innovation is taking place off-campus
       and it takes a long time for the schools to realize these
       trends and incorporate it into the curriculum. That’s why
       there’s a huge skill gap, where employers say graduates
       aren’t job-ready.
     * Degree programs are incredibly inefficient. Using hirable
       skills like programming or marketing as an example, where
       these skills can be learned in 3–6 months. It doesn’t take
       a four-year degree to learn them. And since trends in such
       subjects change so quickly, your learnings may be obsolete
       by the time you graduate.

   Despite these trends, universities have refused to change. None
   of this is new. It’s been like this for decades. But it gets
   worse each year. And I have little confidence that they will
   change. Administrators are making bloated salaries. Professors
   make six-figure salaries, receive tenure, and generous pension
   benefits. Student loan companies are making billions on
   students. Too many people are benefiting from the current
   system and resist changes. It’s up to the student to demand
   them.

   But they will demand it eventually. And Silicon Valley is
   taking note. They will offer something competitive to the
   university and force them to change. It’s already happening in
   the tech industries with online education, coding bootcamps,
   and other innovative collaboration programs.

   Consider some other industries and examples of when content
   started really improving as a result of opening up competition:
     * When Netflix/Amazon/HBO/Showtime figured out that they can
       have independent programs free from the grasps of the cable
       companies, the content suddenly improved.
     * Ever search for books on Amazon lately? Free from the major
       publishing company constraints, there are endless choices
       from independent authors. Quality is assured because Amazon
       has such a strong rating/review section.
     * The hospitality industry has been forced into top quality
       customer experience. Ever book a hotel on your travel site
       of choice? If a hotel gets poorly reviewed, it can have a
       massive impact on their business (Why book a hotel with an
       average 3.5/5 rating when you can see 20 other options with
       greater than 4.0?). Ditto for restaurants, bars, and
       anything else being reviewed
     * Dislike the taxi monopoly filled with too many instances of
       poor hygiene drivers and vehicles, unsafe driving, and fare
       scams if you off if you’re not native to the city? Uber and
       competitors have fixed that.

   We live in the information age where nobody can get away with
   providing a bad experience or a routinely poor business model,
   and higher education should be taking notice. Among the areas
   we already see or soon expect to follow a similar pattern:
    1. Professors that teach poorly will be reviewed and nobody
       will ever sign up for their class again. Likewise, the best
       professors will get rave reviews and have near unlimited
       demand for their courses.
    2. University statistics will be transparent for all to see.
       Didn’t graduate with a job in your major? That university
       will have some explaining to do. Those providing amazing
       content for low costs (think Netflix) will have unlimited
       demand for their services.
    3. Cost will soon be a major factor in education decisions.
       Just like the Comcasts and Time Warners of the world better
       adapt to competitors offering a la carte programming and
       lower cost providers of quality content. The big
       universities will face pressure from low cost providers and
       those offering a model different than the “commit to our
       high cost four year program or else” requirement.

The University of the Future

   Without further ado, let’s take a look at my future higher
   education vision…

   1) The brand name university — Harvard, Stanford, Oxford and
   the other most prestigious universities have very little to
   worry about. They will be operating under a similar structure
   as today and cater towards those looking for the high service
   model (and willing to pay the costs associated with that
   service). Just as Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Prada shoes and
   Dom Perignon champagne do quite well as luxury brands, the
   luxury university brands will remain an appealing option to
   many. Will they offer high quality just as the other luxury
   brands do? Absolutely. Will that quality justify several price
   multiples higher? Perhaps to the wealthy, however, quality
   alternatives will exist to the middle class.

   2) The experience university — Eventually a bright entrepreneur
   will realize there are alternative ways of educating people
   than the lecture/classroom model. Not everyone is a
   visual/audio learner and not everyone excels in the ‘study for
   a test’ environment. Some want to learn by doing or learn from
   experience. I have little doubt there will be specific higher
   education options for those seeking this experience. Perhaps it
   will be a four year option or maybe it will have a smaller
   timeframe than that. However, we will likely see learning
   organizations that nix the textbooks, tests, lectures and
   classrooms for something different. This might not work for
   math or accounting fields, but it would be very attractive for
   the sciences and liberal arts. I wouldn’t be surprised if this
   was offered by large corporations as an education training
   program to eventually work for them (it wouldn’t be a bad idea
   for them to make such an investment actually!).

   3) The budget university — For those looking to get educated in
   the most efficient way possible, I believe a budget university
   will emerge. I expect tuition to resemble community college
   level pricing but for bachelor degrees to be offered. These
   budget universities will leverage online content for lectures
   and have a minimal local campus reach (perhaps rented space for
   discussions in certain classes). Professors will likely be
   employed at a temporary contract level and be sourced from
   industry rather than academia. All the “extras” like research
   facilities, athletics, university organizations, graduate
   school, and specialized classes/majors will not be part of
   these universities. They will offer you the most common majors
   and efficiently get you from admission to graduation. Quality
   will likely be questionable at many universities. However, I
   believe some will figure out the right way to assemble great
   content for a low price. Experience will be limited, however,
   as it should in a budget operating model.

   4) Online Universities — I love companies like Coursera, EdX,
   and Udacity. These businesses offer learning paths that lead to
   real skills and real jobs if you leverage them correctly. A lot
   of people criticize online learning but these companies have
   only been around for a few years. They improve in quantity and
   quality every year.

   As time goes on, more of these will pop up. Some might
   specialize in certain subjects and offer learning/training
   paths. And others like Udemy might provide general learning on
   any subject. The quality has provided a viable alternative to
   the learning portion of the university experience. Combine that
   with my company’s ([13]Reverse Tide) career services and you
   can turn your learning/skills into a great career.

   5) The Foreign university — Around the world, many universities
   are subsidized by their respective governments, and thus can
   offer education for free or at very low costs to their
   students. Not all are attempting to be profitable, as they’re
   quasi-government institutions. However, there are some
   fantastic opportunities to apply a price arbitrage overseas.

   Take the Philippines as a great example. A smart businessperson
   could set up a university in the US, get the necessary
   accreditation and then set up a sister campus on the beaches of
   English speaking Cebu. They would have little trouble
   convincing students to move overseas for two years, offering a
   degree for less than $5k/year and effectively giving them a US
   degree with a ” Philippines study abroad” option for half its
   length. They could hire teachers from around the world that
   would, put much of their content online and then graduate their
   students in the US. They would leverage the same cost arbitrage
   done by businesses in every other industry, have an
   international education experience to sell and find the best
   content to be delivered virtually. Content creation, grading,
   customer service, technology, and all the other “high cost”
   things done on the American campuses would be done by
   well-educated Filipinos at a fraction of the labor cost.

   The Philippines is just one example. This can be done across
   the world and with more than one satellite campus. We just need
   the right businessperson willing to deal with the education
   politics of each region and the logistics. It will happen
   eventually.

   6) The Advanced vocational school — I think this is going to be
   a pretty big one and may offer partnerships with some of the
   other options on our list. Right now vocational schools are
   aimed at providing education toward specific industries or
   trades. The perception is that they might offer a good
   opportunity to get into a specific job. Overall, however,
   education quality is lower than the higher ranked bachelor
   degree institutions.

   I believe some very prestigious and high ranked vocational
   schools will begin to emerge. Schools that have only a few
   majors and will focus on high growth, high income jobs
   primarily in engineering and technology. The format of such
   schools will almost be like a boot camp, where it is faster
   paced and efficient in skill development. While more diverse
   education might be provided, it will be significantly less
   emphasized than today’s education structure. I also expect such
   schools to be almost a feeder-like program where jobs are
   virtually guaranteed in highly technical corporations and
   government entities.

   As mentioned, these are just predictions, but every day we see
   more and more reason for the industry to evolve in these ways.
   All in all, I believe it is a great thing for education.
   Democratizing the industry so there is more choice, more
   customization, and a marketplace of greater price and quality
   competitiveness is an amazing thing for the education consumer
   (the student).

   When will this happen? I believe within the next 10 years,
   you’ll see these options really start booming and traditional
   universities shrinking from the superior competitors.
