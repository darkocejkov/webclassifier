   While cases of Covid-19 surge to new highs nationwide,
   responsible outdoor activities are being encouraged. From
   California to New York, states and cities are shutting down
   indoor dining (or keeping it closed) while allowing outdoor
   service and keeping beaches and parks open, too. Governors are
   coming around to the view that scientists have been espousing
   for months: The coronavirus transmits more easily indoors than
   outdoors.

   “The risk is definitely lower outdoors,” says Kimberly Prather,
   PhD, an atmospheric chemist at the Scripps Institution of
   Oceanography. “The primary reason is there’s just such a large
   volume of clean air.”

   Imagine a tablespoon of saltwater dispersing in a bucket of
   fresh water versus in a small glass of water, she suggests.
   Sunlight has also been [14]shown to kill the coronavirus, she
   says, although the effect takes a few minutes.

     [14] https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa334/5856149?fbclid=IwAR3jqSUPN8mFgSNcG8hmoCgTjLB8rf2q_eqgKSzuoisRjN40XlkKoPb9NdE

   However, outdoors is not totally safe, and images of crowded
   beaches and maskless pool parties over the Fourth of July
   weekend have health experts worried that [15]already
   skyrocketing infection rates will [16]just get worse. After
   all, an infected person’s coronavirus-laden respiratory
   exhalations don’t always obey the six-foot rule.

     [15] https://elemental.medium.com/5-stages-of-the-pandemic-and-why-covid-19-will-get-worse-e8e6d82f5772
     [16] https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-covid-19-world-updates-20200706-rvo5gdnfnvbhxdigd2hk7pgcya-story.html

   “I’m wearing a surgical mask at all times and I’m farther away
   than six feet. I’m at least 10, indoors or outdoors,” Prather
   tells Elemental. “Distance is your friend. Always.” Prather
   admits she’s more cautious than many people, both because of
   what she knows and what remains unknown.

     “The risk is definitely lower outdoors. The primary reason
     is there’s just such a large volume of clean air.”

How the coronavirus gets airborne

   The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 can be passed along by
   handshakes or after landing on surfaces, and [17]maybe even
   through human feces. But the primary means of spread is thought
   to be through the air, especially in poorly ventilated indoor
   spaces, and especially within six feet.

     [17] https://elemental.medium.com/toilet-flushing-could-spread-covid-19-in-the-air-via-poop-droplets-23ff89e65f84

   Here’s what happens: When we breathe, talk, sing, cough, or
   sneeze, we spew droplets of various sizes, from the visible to
   the microscopic. Scientists [18]recently measured droplets from
   a cough flying 16 feet indoors and sneeze droplets traveling 26
   feet. Each droplet contains moist mucus and saliva, plus salts
   and proteins, cells from the respiratory system, and other
   bodily stuff. In a person infected with Covid-19, the droplets
   can also contain super tiny coronavirus particles. The
   measurements are in microns, or millionths of a meter.

     [18] https://edgerton.mit.edu/how_disease_epidemics_move_through_air

   Upon hitting the air, the droplets begin evaporating
   immediately. Larger, heavier ones tend to fall quickly. Others
   lose most or all of their moisture and shrink down to as small
   as five microns or less, a mere nucleus of the former droplet.
   Somewhere around this rough threshold, the droplets become
   aerosols, able to stay suspended in the air for minutes or
   hours, says Prather, who explained it in a recent
   [19]perspective article in the journal Science.

     [19] https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/1422

   Indoors, virus-infected aerosols can spread throughout an
   entire room and effectively create an invisible, infectious
   cloud.

   How long the coronavirus remains infectious in aerosols is an
   open question, however. A recent [20]study in the New England
   Journal of Medicine suggests the virus can remain viable in
   aerosols that can drift about for many minutes or hours. In an
   enclosed space, they’ll be constantly replenished as long as
   people keep breathing. If individuals are talking loudly,
   shouting, or [21]singing, even more viral particles are spewed.

     [20] https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973
     [21] https://elemental.medium.com/why-singers-might-be-covid-19-super-spreaders-57607ed71b9b

     “It’s not about one inhalation. It’s about sitting there and
     breathing it over time.”

   “In a poorly ventilated indoor environment where you need to
   shout to be heard, the six-foot separation rule will not be
   effective,” says Dr. Donald Milton, an environmental health
   professor at the University of Maryland and an expert on
   airborne infections.

Why outside is less risky

   Whether you come down with Covid-19 depends on two primary
   factors: dosage (how many viral particles you inhale) and
   duration (for how long you inhale them). The thresholds are not
   known. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says
   a person should be tested or isolated if they’ve been exposed
   to someone infectious, closer than six feet for at least 15
   minutes, regardless whether either was wearing a mask or not.

   “It’s not about one inhalation,” Prather explains. “It’s about
   sitting there and breathing it over time.”

   Aerosols will follow circulation patterns — they drift with the
   wind, in sort of a plume. Prather uses cigarette smoke as an
   analogy to understand the plumes you might encounter: “If a
   person was smoking and talking to me, where would I sit, to not
   breathe their smoke?”

   A recent [22]computer modeling effort illustrates what can
   happen when someone coughs outside. Taking into account
   evaporation and air movement, it showed that a slight breeze of
   2.5 mph carried a plume of droplets 18 feet in five seconds. A
   stronger wind keeps the droplets higher off the ground, but
   they’ll disperse more across the same distance, the scientists
   concluded in the journal Physics of Fluids.

   environmental conditions such as wind speed, temperature,
   pressure, and humidity. Wind shown blowing left to right at
   speeds of 2.5 mph (4 kph) in the top image and 9.3 mph (15 kph)
   at the bottom can transport saliva droplets up to 18 feet (6
   meters). Image: Talib Dbouk and Dimitris Drikakis

     [22] https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0011960

   The point is: Whether at an outdoor restaurant or the beach or
   strolling the boardwalk, proximity to others and environmental
   conditions matter. Even with a mask and several feet of
   separation, you wouldn’t want to be just downwind from a group
   of people who are singing or shouting. “If you’re walking
   behind a group of people who are talking, you have to think
   about that, too,” Prather says.

   There are other factors that may further lower risk outside.
   Simulated summer sunlight kills 90% of the coronavirus
   particles in aerosols within six minutes, according to a June
   11 [23]study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

     [23] https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa334/5856149?fbclid=IwAR3jqSUPN8mFgSNcG8hmoCgTjLB8rf2q_eqgKSzuoisRjN40XlkKoPb9NdE

   Heat and high humidity are bad news for many viruses, which is
   one reason the flu subsides in summer. But it’s not yet clear
   whether or how quickly they disable the coronavirus. One
   indication: Unlike the flu, Covid-19 has been raging throughout
   southern states despite the heat of summer. The simulated
   sunlight study found no evidence that humidity alone kills the
   virus.

Being outside is just one layer of protection

   No single protective measure is foolproof, but in a layered
   approach, they add up. Prather explains one aspect of this with
   some funky math: If two people who are near each other are both
   wearing masks that are, say, 50% effective, the combined
   efficiency between them is 75%.

   If they back up, that helps. If they’re outside, that’s even
   better.

   “There’s a reason why we have stacked up so many imperfect
   measures” to reduce risk, says Dr. Neha Nanda, an expert on
   emerging infectious diseases at Keck Medicine of the University
   of Southern California. “Each lever has an additive benefit and
   they complement each other, and all are imperfect. So at a
   given time, we want to apply all if possible to reduce the
   risk.”

   One hint that outdoor gatherings can be relatively safe:
   Protests around the country, which started in late May and most
   often involved a lot of mask-wearing, have [24]not yet produced
   any known, significant outbreaks, based on early data from
   several cities. Experts worry they still might, but even in New
   York City, [25]no significant protest-related surge has yet
   been identified as of July 1.

     [24] https://elemental.medium.com/masks-help-prevent-covid-19-spread-at-protests-early-data-suggest-9669fde45425
     [25] https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-protests.html

   Because so many [26]younger people are now getting infected,
   often passing the disease along without knowing it, because
   they may not have symptoms, prevention requires constant
   vigilance from everyone in a community, the experts say.

     [26] https://elemental.medium.com/surge-in-younger-covid-19-infections-could-worsen-the-pandemic-4622aa43126

     Simulated summer sunlight kills 90% of the coronavirus
     particles in aerosols within six minutes, according to a
     June 11 study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Clearing up confusing communication

   The messaging on all this has been confusing, scientists admit,
   in part because it took time to figure out the behavior of a
   novel virus that emerged just six months ago. Every virus has
   different means and levels of infectiousness and durability.
   Additional confusion has been created by suggestions that
   there’s a firm cutoff between droplets and aerosols. Rather,
   experts agree, [27]there’s a continuum of sizes, therefore a
   range of distances across which the virus might be carried.

     [27] https://haicontroversies.blogspot.com/2020/07/a-tiresome-spat.html

   As one example of the evolving advice, even the World Health
   Organization has been reluctant to acknowledge what the vast
   majority of experts now agree on, based on a [28]letter sent to
   the WHO this week by more than 200 scientists: The coronavirus
   can spread via airborne, aerosol-sized respiratory particles
   well beyond six feet. The scientists admit direct evidence for
   this is lacking — you can’t gather people, spray the virus all
   around, and see what happens.

     [28] https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798

   “Is aerosol transmission possible? Well it’s not proven, but
   absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,” says William
   Hanage, PhD, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard
   T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “It can be possible on some
   occasions, and yet the majority of transmission can be
   short-range and droplet — which the majority of studies suggest
   it is.”

   Among the indirect evidence for aerosol transmission: Several
   “[29]superspreader” events, in which one person has infected
   dozens or hundreds of others, at a [30]choir practice, at
   [31]nightclubs, and on [32]cruise ships. Adding to the
   consensus conclusion is the overall speed and pervasiveness of
   the coronavirus spread.

     [29] https://elemental.medium.com/the-science-of-superspreaders-2ceed2b68834
     [30] https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e6.htm

     [32] https://medium.com/luminate/how-dangerous-are-covid-19-silent-spreaders-fcd48a9d881b

   The WHO has since [33]formally acknowledged that aerosol
   transmission, particularly among those who are indoors for long
   periods of time, “cannot be ruled out.”

     [33] https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-how-is-covid-19-transmitted

   Meanwhile, some scientists are concerned that calling the
   coronavirus “airborne” will instill unnecessary fear,
   especially given how quickly it disperses outside. Measles is
   decidedly and very dangerously airborne, for example, but other
   viruses don’t survive at all outside the body.

   “When we talk about aerosols, especially with Covid-19, it’s
   really about closer interaction within an enclosed space,” says
   Saskia Popescu, PhD, an epidemiologist and adjunct professor of
   public health at the University of Arizona. “We know that
   primarily, transmission is through droplet transmission,”
   Popescu tells Elemental. “Aerosols can be generated, but we
   shouldn’t take this as ‘it’s airborne!’ — rather a layer of
   transmission to consider.”

     Even with a mask and several feet of separation, you
     wouldn’t want to be just downwind from a group of people who
     are singing or shouting.

What experts are willing to do outdoors

   After three months of online school at home, Jennifer Horney’s
   kids needed to get out. Horney, PhD, an epidemiologist and
   professor at the University of Delaware, understands how
   Covid-19 is transmitted. But she also understands that we can’t
   all stay cooped up forever. She emphasizes that the best way to
   combat the physical and mental downsides of isolation “is to do
   some outdoor activities that are relatively safe compared to
   other things,” including hiking, biking, or swimming, so long
   as physical distancing can be maintained.

   So her kids are now spending time at a local community pool,
   where they swim in lanes only with other family members, and
   Hula-Hoops mark off each child’s space on the pool deck.

   Horney knows that chlorine and bromine, in a properly
   maintained pool, [34]inactive the coronavirus. Two other keys
   to Horney’s decision to give her kids a break: In Delaware,
   mask-wearing is widely accepted, and the level of community
   transmission has been low compared to other states.

     [34] https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/parks-rec/park-administrators.html

   “What I’m willing to do both personally and to advise people
   professionally is really contingent on what [the metrics] look
   like in our community,” she says in a phone interview. “It all
   goes back to your local situation.”

   She would not, for example, take her family to a crowded beach
   in California or Florida, where new cases are surging, and
   where she’d have less control over the behavior of others.

   Marc Lipsitch, PhD, a professor of epidemiology and director of
   the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard T.H.
   Chan School of Public Health, knows as much as anyone about
   this pandemic. I asked him if, given all he understands, he’d
   go to an outdoor restaurant during the pandemic.

   “I have, actually, once,” he said. It was with family and one
   friend, who he describes as almost family. “I don’t think
   that’s a riskless activity,” Lipsitch says. “But the wait staff
   was masked, and we were masked when we weren’t eating.”
   Importantly, he notes, this was in a part of Massachusetts
   where he knew there were very few cases.

   “That seems completely reasonable to me,” he says. “If I were
   in Houston, Texas, I might not.”
